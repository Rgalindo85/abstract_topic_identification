       " '2026324': \"Thousands of procured kidneys are discarded each year due to inefficient workflow processes and negative perceptions for using lower quality or higher risk organs. While some of this discard is medically necessary, some represents lost opportunities to get patients off of dialysis and increase lifespans. This Future of Work at the Human Technology Frontier planning grant project aims to transform the organ transplant matching process. The future technology is an artificial intelligence (AI) system with usable trustworthy interfaces that are fully integrated into the transplant healthcare work context between the demand-side (transplant center) and supply-side (organ procurement organization). The future workers are organ procurement coordinators and transplant coordinators, physicians and surgeons. A single kidney can have thousands of offers before one, if any, transplant center accepts it. The current process of manually placing lower quality organs exacerbates lost opportunities. The AI system will identify transplant teams and candidates that are most likely to accept a lower quality organ so that the match can be identified quickly and the organ is less likely to be discarded. This planning grant will build capacity for integrating AI into transplant healthcare and engage workers as well as pre- and post-transplant patients in a design-a-thon event. This research is driven by transplant experts at Saint Louis University Hospital and experts in AI and human factors from Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology. Once validated, this research can also be applied to other data-intensive high-stakes scenarios (e.g. military operations, critical infrastructure).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AI systems often suffer from technical, human, and integration challenges. Over the course of the planning grant, we will (1) document a transplant work system architecture and identify challenges for re-designing this work process, (2) develop a proof-of-concept AI system to predict which candidates are most likely to accept a lower quality kidney that is at risk of discard, and (3) perform human subjects experiments to scope the interface design and predict technology adoption factors. It is time-consuming and costly to manually design neural architectures, so this project proposes an approach that uses evolutionary algorithms to find the optimal architecture for a particular data set. This will facilitate real-time adaptation as the data inputs evolve over time. In addition, it is critical for AI systems to be explainable and transparent, particularly in high stakes contexts.

Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirms that the black population accounted for 30% of cases of the virus in the United States, although it is only approximately 13% of the US population. In New York city, an epicenter of COVID-19, data also show that the black population represents 28% of deaths due to COVID-19. The goal of the VAPOC (Visualization, Analysis and Prediction of COVID-19) project is to find out reasons as to why the black community is disproportionately impacted during the coronavirus pandemic. It seems a combination of factors is responsible for African Americans’ susceptibility to COVID-19. This poses a pattern recognition as well as knowledge discovery problem. It is hypothesized that pre-existing conditions, type of employment, and access to healthcare among other factors have significant influences in the higher death rate of African Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.

       " '2034734': \"Light gases such as methane, ethane, and ethylene play an important role in industrial applications, including their use as gas and liquid fuels and as precursors in polymer manufacturing. Access to high purity gases is typically required for these applications necessitating an industrial gas separation process. Gas separation technology is also required to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Accordingly, the development of low-energy and low-cost separations of gas mixtures is critically important to meet industrial demand, address environmental concerns, and improve standards of living. Separating gas molecules from a mixture requires materials (molecular sieves) containing holes with uniform dimensions that are comparable with the sizes of the small gas molecules to be separated. However, suitable molecular sieve particles are usually difficult to form into the geometries necessary for scales relevant to industrial applications or environmental remediation. This project will advance the fundamental science of forming molecular sieve particles into well-connected networks, which will enable the development of large-scale separation technologies. In the networks, the particles will be held together by polymer interfaces designed to minimize any adverse effects on the particle sieving function and, at the same time, preserve the structural integrity of the material. The separation performance, gas transport properties, and structural properties of such networks will be quantified on all relevant length scales. The outcomes of this project will lay the foundation for rationally designed molecular sieve morphologies that can be optimized for the desired gas separation. The investigators will also initiate a new research mentoring program with the objective of teaching and training students from underrepresented groups in STEM. Existing institutional programs will be leveraged, and the use of online tools will be emphasized to enhance the program's effectiveness.<br/><br/>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are high porosity molecular sieves exhibiting extraordinary property sets when applied in membrane-based gas separations. However, these materials cannot be easily formed into defect-free membrane geometries. Hence, it is challenging to leverage the intrinsic transport benefits of MOFs for membrane separations. Mixing MOF crystals with polymers to make mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) is a well-known strategy to form MOF-based membranes. However, the typical separation performance of MMMs is usually lower than that of the corresponding MOFs because MMM transport properties are unfavorably affected by the polymer phase and, in some cases, by interfacial MOF–polymer defects. A clear route to improve MMM performance is to increase MOF concentrations and even reach a percolation threshold to enable diffusion predominantly through the MOF phase, i.e., a situation when gas diffusion in MMMs can proceed mostly over interconnected MOF crystals. The investigators will develop the fundamental science of crossing the percolation threshold for gas transport in the MOF phase of MOF–polymer MMMs to enable separation performance comparable with that of pure MOF membranes. Membrane fabrication strategies will be developed based on a novel functionalization of the external surface of MOF crystals in combination with the development of fundamental understanding of intramembrane gas transport. Advanced nuclear magnetic resonance will be used to investigate changes of all relevant types of microscopic gas transport in MMMs as a function of increasing MOF loading and the diffusion length scale. MOF surface functionalization will also be optimized with respect to enhancing the mechanical properties of the membranes. This project will lead to the development of fundamental chemical separations knowledge related to percolation theory in composites. If successful, this concept will enable pure MOF-like transport properties to be accessed in membranes without the requirement of forming pure MOF films. In this way, new performance limits may be achieved for MMMs, including percolated transport for MOFs that are not easily formed into crystalline films. As a design platform, this approach could be used to improve the productivity and efficiency of chemical separations for membranes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

Multiple social science methods, including media content analysis, in-depth stakeholder interviews, deliberative workshops, and interpretive comparative methods, are used to investigate this emerging scientific controversy and develop ways to create more inclusive governance processes for decision making related to controversial and emergent technologies. Project goals include: (1) Identifying key visions for technoscientific futures and their proponents; 2) Assessing how key actors develop and use particular visions of the future to stabilize or disrupt public trust in gene editing technologies and their governance; 3) Comparing visions of the futures across cases; and 4) Engaging key actors in deliberative workshops to provide an assessment of findings and deliberate on inclusive governance approaches. Overall, the project will contribute to the theory and practice of Responsible Research and Innovation, and to scholarship in Science and Technology Studies on governance of emerging technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2008973': \"This project aims to investigate novel spatial machine learning algorithms based on imperfect volunteered geographical information as ground truth for applications at the intersection of machine learning and geographic information science. The rapid growth of geospatial and spatiotemporal data being collected from space, airborne, and terrestrial platforms provides scientists, farmers, and first responders critical information they need about the surface of the Earth. This emerging area that intersects machine learning, especially deep learning, with geographic information science is called GeoAI. GeoAI can potentially transform society by addressing grand challenges such as rapid disaster response, water resource management, and transportation. One major obstacle, however, is that deep learning heavily relies on a large number of training labels, which are often not easily available for geographic applications due to slow and expensive field surveys. Existing research on semi-supervised learning could not fully resolve the issues due to the complex nature of geographic data such as spatial heterogeneity. This project will fill the gap by exploiting large scale, low-cost, and near real-time volunteered geographic information. The project will contribute towards the next generation water resource management for the U.S. in the 21st century. This research can not only improve the situational awareness for disaster response agencies but also enhance the flood forecasting capabilities of the National Water Model. Planned algorithms will be implemented into open source tools that will enhance the research infrastructure for disaster management and hydrology communities. Educational activities include curriculum development, K-12 computer science education at Alabama Computer Science Summer Camps. The principal investigator has a past record in mentoring undergraduate students from a historically black university and will continue the efforts at the University of Alabama, which has a reputation for producing African American researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned framework will bring about several innovations to address significant technical challenges due to data quality issues. First, to address the noisy, biased, and incomplete label semantics, the project will develop novel label enhancement and enrichment algorithms based on physics-aware spatial structural constraints, which advance existing methods (that often assume independent labels) by jointly enhancing labels based on structural dependency. Second, the project will explore a new location error model that better captures geometric shapes than existing square patch-based models, and design efficient joint learning algorithms to update deep model parameters while inferring true shape locations. Finally, to address location ambiguity, the project will explore location ambiguity models and mitigating location ambiguity by leveraging geographical contexts from input imagery features as well as spatial hierarchical constraints. Such ideas advance existing location disambiguation methods merely based on the textual semantic context in natural language processing. The project can potentially transform the field of geospatial data science by addressing a major obstacle of limited training labels by a systematic framework of exploiting large-scale, low-cost, and near real-time volunteered geographic information data. The project can potentially make transformative impacts on interdisciplinary GeoAI applications such as rapid disaster response and national water forecasting.

As COVID-19 continues to spread, the effectiveness of different testing strategies and predictive models are brought into question. Testing strategies include the use of drive-through facilities that have found success elsewhere but may prove impractical for elderly and low-income sections of the population, and the use of hospitals, which adds further burden to the healthcare system and may carry the risk of higher contagion. Mathematical models that forecast the spread of the disease are of paramount importance to inform local and global policy makers on the course of action that should be undertaken to mitigate the outbreak and give relief to the population. However, such models are often confounded by the absence of symptoms in early stages, complex mobility patterns, and limited testing resources. This award supports fundamental research toward a mathematical model that will overcome these confounding factors, through advancements in dynamics and control. By explicitly modeling social and mobility constraints, this research will help increase the general well-being of communities and reduce disparities across the population. The model will afford the simulation of critical what-if scenarios and will include the evaluation of different testing policies and mitigation actions, thereby constituting a valuable support to policy makers involved in the containment and eradication of the epidemic. Research outcomes will be presented to the public, including health professionals and authorities to inform public policy in the ongoing crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will respond to COVID-19 outbreak in real time through a fine-resolution agent-based and data-driven model that aims at providing unprecedented insight in the spread and potential mitigation strategies of this virus at the city level. The approach will afford thorough what-if analysis on the effectiveness of ongoing and potential mitigation strategies. The agent-based model will include COVID-19 specific features, such as the type and timing of testing, asymptomatic occurrence, and hospitalization stages. The framework will be grounded in publicly available census and geo-referred data from New Rochelle, New York.  Social behavior associated with rational and irrational factors will be included in the mobility patterns of the agent-based model at multiple spatial and temporal scales to increase the granularity of the predictions. Network-theoretic and data-driven control strategies will inform enhanced testing protocols involving active trials on the basis of available contact databases collected at testing sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2029765': \"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to establish recyclable thermoplastics that are based on polystyrene-substitute materials since plastics made of polystyrene itself are not commonly recycled. Polymers are an essential material class used in nearly all modern products. However, most of the used polymer products are landfilled, improperly discarded, or incinerated and thus have environmental consequences. The high-cost problem of polymer recycling suggests the desirability to develop new polymers with low-cost and facile recyclability without compromising physical properties needed for practical applications. This research aims to establish a new class of recyclable thermoplastics that can effectively substitute polystyrene. Polystyrene is one of the largest produced thermoplastic polymers used as a key component for numerous commodity and specialty applications. However, polystyrene has been barely recycled due to high cost. The proposed research will replace non-recyclable polystyrene with new high-performance thermoplastics that can be recycled from used products at low cost. This research will significantly benefit society by establishing polystyrene-substituting recyclable thermoplastics that could remedy the environmental problems caused by polystyrene wastes. The planned work also includes educational activities for K-12 and undergraduate students to enhance their exposure and understanding of STEM fields with a focus on polymers and materials structures. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The planned research aims to establish and study recyclable thermoplastic polymers as polystyrene substitutes through implementing low-cost and facile depolymerizability. The depolymerizability will be achieved by copolymerizing monomer with a low-ceiling temperature and other monomer that controls the properties of polymers.  A library of recyclable copolymers will be synthesized, depolymerization characteristics of the polymer library will be studied, and optical and viscoelastic properties of the copolymers will be characterized for evaluation of the new polymers as polystyrene substitutes and beyond. These efforts will establish the correlations between the chemical composition of the copolymers and the physical/depolymerization properties. The established correlations of recyclable copolymers will serve as the design criteria of polymers for target applications. The project will provide graduate and undergraduate students with broad research training on polymers ranging from synthesis to characterization and materials properties.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2007498': \"The use of wireless networks is rapidly extending towards applications with strict reliability and/or latency constraints. For example, in 5G cellular systems, standards not only specify average data rates but also the minimum rates that 95% of the users should be able to achieve. Meanwhile, for vehicular safety messaging or in manufacturing, extremely high reliability under strict latency constraints is required. In contrast to these developments, the theoretical tools available for wireless network analysis and design mostly focus on network-wide averages, which makes them unsuitable for these new applications. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop a theory for networks with strict performance constraints and guarantees. This project focuses on the development of such a theory, which will allow a sharp performance analysis and enable researchers and engineers in industry to characterize the user experience much more efficiently than by lengthy and expensive simulations. Accordingly, it is expected to have a significant impact on the design of future wireless systems. In addition, it will help train future generations of students in emerging wireless technologies and analytical techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In view of the increasing density, irregularity, and uncertainty in the locations of wireless transceivers, a probabilistic approach to modeling and analysis that includes the network geometry as its key ingredient is warranted.  Stochastic geometry is the natural mathematical tool for modeling and analysis. However, its use has been largely restricted to the derivation of average performance metrics, which do not capture the disparity in the link or user performances nor incorporate reliability or latency constraints. To address these shortcomings, this project develops a new theoretical framework, called deep stochastic geometry, that focuses on spatial distributions rather than merely averages. Deep stochastic geometry enables a direct evaluation of the performance of user or link percentiles and the performance under constraints. As such, it is a theory of guaranteed performance, in contrast to the existing theory of average performance. At the heart of the new theory are so-called meta distributions, which are distributions of conditional distributions (given the network geometry). Meta distributions naturally emerge when the different sources of randomness in a network are separated according to their time scales. The specific research activities include the development of efficient numerical methods and simulation techniques to calculate meta distributions, finding effective approximation techniques, the extension of meta distributions to joint distributions, and, finally, the combination of multiple metrics into a comprehensive approach to characterize and optimize network performance under constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2030234': \"Commercial and military wireless systems, radio astronomy observatories, weather radar systems, and other applications, frequently referred to as “passive users,” need to operate in quiet electromagnetic environments with limited interference. Passive users commonly strive to observe faint signals emitted by distant non-coordinating transmitters and their frequency or time separation from other sources may not be possible as they often continuously utilize large swaths of radio spectrum to detect and monitor physical processes that have electromagnetic presence at different frequencies. To fully reap the benefits of spectrum coexistence in 5G and beyond, there is a need to employ passive-user protection approaches that strike an optimal balance between two key objectives, namely reliably protect passive users from interference and maximize spectrum access opportunities for active users. This project addresses foundational challenges in spectrum coexistence by developing a novel low-cost hardware-reduced and multi-parameter reconfigurable ultra-wideband transceiver that  optimizes passive-active spectrum sharing across a broad frequency range. The portability and adaptability of this new transceiver makes it attractive for next-generation mobile wireless platforms, including a variety of autonomous ground and/or airborne platforms, cellular base-stations, unmanned airborne and satellite communication systems and specifically impact 5G, Wi-Fi and future applications of connected autonomy. Through this project the PIs propose to train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students targeting Hispanic, women, and other underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) through specialized outreach efforts and curriculum development.&lt;br/&gt;The project brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers with complementary expertise ranging from Radio Frequency (RF) front-end hardware design, to Physical (PHY) and Medium-Access Control (MAC) layer optimization, to artificial intelligence (AI) theory and practice. To avoid hardware constraints and lack of reconfigurability imposed by analog and hybrid beamforming architectures the project develops a novel digital ultra-wideband beamforming architecture that enables: 1) Efficient spectrum utilization and interference-free passive-active coexistence through robust space-time-frequency sensing and cross-layer optimization at the PHY and MAC layers; 2) autonomous hardware multi-parameter tunability for ultra-wideband operation across 5G bands; and 3) practical realization of low-cost, versatile hardware-reduced wireless systems through new artificial-neural-network-aided code multiplexed array front-ends. Robust spectrum sensing involves new L1-norm principal-component analysis to assess the quality (validity and completeness) of the collected/sensed spectrum data and produce high-confidence power propagation and spatial coordination maps of active spectrum users. The project leverages high-quality radio maps, autonomous sub-arraying, multi-band, and multi-parameter reconfigurability across large bandwidths and incorporates reinforcement learning strategies to address the cross-layer PHY/MAC and front-end control problem for harmonious passive-active spectrum coexistence. The complete outcome of this project is expected to be an autonomously reconfigurable hardware-reduced platform that will allow integration of ultra-wideband sensing and beamforming functionalities in small-form-factor software-defined radio platforms. This new class of low-cost, versatile, hardware-reduced wireless transceivers that integrate multiple radio chains into a practical single lightweight package is enabled by the application of neural networks to cancel both linear and non-linear components of inter-channel interference that arise during the multiplexing of multiple non-orthogonal spread signal paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

Results of this research may be the basis for identifying biomarkers of severity of disease or spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 or COVID). This project will produce an understanding of why some coronavirus strains that normally infect specific animals (such as birds and bats) sometimes also infect humans, whereas other strains do not. This knowledge is critical for understanding how viruses break species barriers to colonize new hosts and precipitate widespread infections, as experienced during the ongoing COVID pandemic. Coronaviruses infect cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and passing through organelles known as endosomes and lysosomes to access the cell interior. This project will investigate how the environment within these cellular structures regulates the intensity of viral infection. Through the use of comparative biology across different vertebrate species, the goal will be to identify conditions in endosomes and lysosomes that facilitate infection in particular organisms. This research may be the basis for identifying biomarkers of severity of disease or COVID spread. This research will also provide tools to enable a broad research community working on COVID and other viruses. This proposal also uses funding to train graduate and undergraduate students. As such this funding is training the next generation of leaders in science. Results expected from this work will facilitate identification and control of COVID spread in humans and other animals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coronoaviridae (CoVs) are a family of single-stranded RNA viruses that infect three vertebrate groups: mammals, birds and fish. Understanding the molecular determinants underpinning this tropism, namely why CoVs naturally and efficiently infect these species, and target specific tissues within these animals, is a fundamental biological concept. Definition of the mechanisms restricting CoV tropism is therefore critical for our understanding of how CoVs break species barriers and colonize new hosts. In this RAPID proposal, the role of the luminal microenvironment of the endolysosomal system in determining the efficiency of CoV infection will be studied for different CoVs in different vertebrate species. The central hypothesis is that the cellular proteins called ion channels resident in endosomes and lysosomes are differentially present in lower mammals and humans. Furthermore, these ion channels uniquely create environments within endosomes and lysosomes in lower mammals that are critical for supporting coronaviral infection  and the differential expression of endolysosomal ion channels between tissues and species regulates the effectiveness of CoV infection. This hypothesis will be tested using a variety of cell models, imaging approaches and infection assays.

In many situations, particularly in the public health domain, it may be difficult or prohibitively expensive to design controlled studies to evaluate effective public policies.   As large-scale data collection increases, the design of methods to infer causality between treatment and outcome by partitioning observations into appropriate sets has become an attractive alternative.  Current methods underlying causal inference suffer from several fundamental challenges that may lead to sub-optimal policy selection. This project will develop tractable computational approaches to facilitate better policy decision making. As an important use case, the project will evaluate policies for improving treatment quality of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) using large-scale U.S. healthcare data.  The integrated education and research plan will attract and involve a diverse student body, from high school through graduate school, in research and practice.

The research objectives are to (1) establish a robust causal inference framework with matching methods to reduce uncertainty, (2) ensure covariate balance in high dimensional space, (3) develop optimal covariate balance techniques to reduce bias and model dependency by ensuring desired distributional properties, and (4) evaluate and advance U.S. healthcare policies based on this framework. To this end, a rigorous optimization framework will be employed to explicitly account for uncertainties in causal inference, maintain neighborhood structures of high dimensional data in low dimensions with matching requirements, and ensure optimal distributional properties of observational data. Efficient exact solution algorithms will be developed exploiting problem structure. Scalability will be addressed through algorithmic schemes with desirable convergence properties and data structure-based decomposition methods.

Much like stable human communities, stable microbial communities are composed of many different members. Each member pursues their own strategies for survival, while at the same time interacting with each other and the physical environment in positive and negative ways to create a stable “neighborhood.” Like human communities encountering natural disasters or gentrification, microbial communities often encounter natural or human-caused disruption. This project aims to determine and characterize the features that determine if a microbial community can be resilient or malleable to change when disrupted. This question will be addressed by creating simplified models of microbial communities, introducing disruptions like newcomer microbes or genetically altering existing community members, and then seeing how the community composition and behavior changes as a result of these disruptions. This research aims to uncover general rules that will allow more accurate predictions of microbial community responses to disruptions, which will allow for the design of interactions with natural microbial communities in ways that benefit humans and their environments. This project will train undergraduate students from diverse socio-economic and cultural backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The human microbiota and the microbial communities of the environments that humans interact with shape human biology and lives. Previous observational studies have identified compositional features of some of these communities, and a mechanistic understanding how these microbial communities interact with humans is beginning to take shape. The question of how the members in these microbial communities influence each other, however, remains. Bioengineering has the potential to introduce genetically designed microorganisms to human and environmental communities to improve and modify their functions, but fundamental questions about microbe community behavior and device engineering remain unanswered. For example, can a genetically-modified organism enter an existing community and establish itself as a member? The rules that govern how organisms naturally enter or leave the community are unknown. Once there, how will the community affect the behavior of the genetic device and vice versa? These questions will be addressed mechanistically by first developing in vitro microbial community models ranging from pairs of representative organisms grown in batch culture to complex environmental inocula grown in continuous culture. These in vitro models will allow for inexpensive and rapid experimentation compared to currently existing in vivo models. Then, newcomer microbes will be introduced and changes in model community composition and gene expression will be identified through RNA-seq. Tn-seq screening will identify the mechanism by which successful newcomer microbes establish themselves in the model communities. Concurrently, commonly used promoters and reporter genes will be constructed, and their performance quantified at the RNA and protein levels and compared between pure culture and community culture.

The mixtures of these components, sampled by intraplate volcanoes, define isotopic mixing arrays unique to each plume. One of these components, FOZO (“Focal Zone”), is unusual in that it is common to many mantle plumes. The FOZO component is characterized by a specific and relatively narrow compositional range in lead, neodymium, strontium, and helium isotopes, where isotopic compositions of most plumes overlap. Notably, FOZO-type reservoirs retain primordial helium isotopic compositions that have not been as significantly modified by subsequent processes compared to other parts of the mantle. While the strontium-lead-neodymium compositional definition of FOZO has undergone several revisions since it was first identified, primordial helium isotopes have remained an important defining characteristic of this reservoir type. Primordial helium ratios have recently been linked to seismically-detectable structures in the deep mantle as well as parameters in plume systems such as material buoyancy and temperature, suggesting that reservoirs with elevated primordial helium are seismically, thermally, and chemically distinct from “typical” lower mantle material. The findings from this study will improve our understanding of the geochemical evolution of the early Earth. In collaboration with geophysicists and geodynamicists, this study will provide constraints on the size, shape, and development of primordial mantle domains that frequently contribute to deeply-sourced volcanism. In addition, this project will provide two years of support for the PI and broaden her expertise in isotope geochemistry to include short-lived isotope systematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, variations in tungsten isotopes, driven by the decay of an extinct isotope of hafnium, were discovered in plume-derived volcanism. In plumes, anomalous tungsten is found in samples with primordial helium, implying that a second primordial isotopic constraint may exist for FOZO-type melts. Tentatively, FOZO-type material carrying anomalous tungsten and helium have been linked to ultra-low velocity zones detected near the core-mantle boundary. Other compositions thought to sample ambient mantle domains found in plumes lack distinct helium and tungsten anomalies, but additional data are needed to fully test the links between seismic structures and isotopic composition. To test this scenario, plumes that lack evidence of any recycled crustal material, a possible contaminant, will be analyzed for helium and tungsten isotopes. The Louisville, Juan Fernandez, Bowie, Cobb, and Caroline plumes have been selected for their lack of recycled componentry and variable helium isotopic compositions. The new data will then be linked to spatial correlations (or lack thereof) with seismically-resolved lower mantle structures to determine the relationship of FOZO-type melts, ambient lower mantle compositions, and the structure of the deep mantle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

Moreover, historical changes in STEM (e.g., maker spaces, and women’s growing representation in science and mathematics) have prompted questions about whether STEM historical movements have shifted the opportunity structures supporting students’ STEM motivation. Through this project, the researchers take advantage of seven extant datasets to test the following five aims among demographically diverse students across historical time: (1) examining changes and patterns in students’ 1st to 12th grade mathematics and science motivational beliefs; (2) testing the extent to which the changes in students’ motivation predict their mathematics and science achievement and coursework, and STEM college/career choices; (3) determining the extent to which parent STEM experience and support predict students’ motivation; (4) examining intersectionality among gender, race/ethnicity, and college generation in Aims 1-3; and (5) testing conceptual replication across datasets and historical time for Aims 1-4.

The project focuses on broadening participation of underrepresented individuals by investigating their mathematics and science motivational beliefs, STEM outcomes, and parental correlates. Testing these processes across multiple datasets provides a more comprehensive understanding of group differences in terms of measurement, mean-level differences, and process-level differences.

NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by addressing interactions between social systems and natural environment in the following NNA focus areas: Arctic residents, Data and Observation, Global Impact, and Resilient Infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atlantic cod has been an important resource for coastal and inland communities throughout the Atlantic world for at least 1000 years. This humble fish played an important role in feeding communities, developing markets, and facilitating trade and continues to be a vitally important species. Management decisions made about existing cod populations are based on scientist’s ideas of what a baseline ‘normal’ or ‘natural’ cod population is. This ‘baseline’ for cod is mostly based on data from the last 100-150 years, including how large cod populations have been, how large the fish have been, how old, etc. On top of this are ideas of how these fish respond to changing human and environmental conditions. A variety of techniques from marine biology, archaeology, and history now allow us to track changing marine ecological conditions as well as relative population size over the last millennium. By creating a deeper record of cod populations over the last millennium, this project contributes vital data that will improve understanding of the cod fisheries as they reacted to climate, political and economic change in the past and how the Icelandic fishing communities of today can adapt and remain resilient as the fishery changes with warming Atlantic waters and new political and economic drivers. The project uniquely involves international and transdisciplinary research between the natural environment and social systems including archaeology, ecology, history, fisheries and oceanography. The knowledge gained from the project is beneficial to our planning strategy to deal with impacts of environmental change on American fisheries and the people who depend on them. The new interdisciplinary methodology also provides novel opportunities for educating university students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use bones from cod as well as other coastal species that have been excavated from archaeological sites in Iceland and the Faroes over the last 30 years. These sites were lived in from the 9th to the 19th centuries. These bones will be the subject of a variety of biochemical analyses that allow us to track population size, body length, and feeding changes over the last millennia. These analyses will be combined with archaeological and historical methods to build a new and deeper record of the relationship between cod, humans, and the environment that will serve as an important tool in managing this relationship in the present and future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

Understanding biological systems is one of the central goals of Mathematical Biology (MB). MB takes a seemingly opposite approach to ML by carefully matching experimental data and reconstructing the physiology of biological systems. So far, the tools of ML and MB have been mainly distinct. In this project, the Principal Investigator (PI) will seek synergies between these two different methodologies and build mathematical tools that bridge these two approaches. PI will also develop tools to study real-world circadian rhythms and sleep. One tool is a smartphone app the PI will deploy. PI shall also work to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics through outreach to underserved high schools.<br/> <br/>The mathematical models in this project consist of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and stochastic differential equations. One of the primary goals is to build ML tools based on biophysically accurate models of neurons. These models will use the formalism developed by Hodgkin and Huxley. The key problem to be addressed here is how learning can occur with highly nonlinear models and time dependence through improvements on the backpropagation technique. Additionally, the PI will develop approaches that use predictions from currently developed models to enhance classification in ML. Key problems to address here are how to classify ODE models' simulations or incorporate uncertainty into ODE models properly.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Locating, identifying, and selecting suitable mates is a fundamental challenge common to all life. These important aspects of reproduction are often accomplished through chemical communication involving pheromones. Thus, the chemical sense of smell used to detect pheromones is important to successful animal reproduction. African giant pouched rats possess a powerful sense of smell which allows them to communicate using a complex system of pheromone signals. These pheromones are used to pass detailed information to one another about gender, age, reproductive features and quality as potential mates. Despite the importance, little is known about how this information is passed using pheromones or what physical mechanisms are used to detect and interpret these signals. This research seeks to answer these questions and represents the first steps toward establishing a unique rodent model of reproduction and chemical communication that will advance the understanding of how appropriate mates are identified. The fellow will broaden participation within the scientific community by including undergraduate student researchers at the beginning of their careers and through collaborative international field research involving students and researchers from Sokoine University of Agriculture in Morogoro, Tanzania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing an integrative approach combining behavioral, physiological and molecular evidence, this research seeks to describe the genetic and biological substrates facilitating detection, identification and evaluation of potential mates in the African giant pouched rat. First, the genetic potential for expression of vomeronasal chemical receptor proteins will be investigated using in-silico genomic analyses comparing receptor repertoires of related species to identify biologically relevant genes and provide insight regarding the relative biological importance of the vomeronasal chemosensory system of the pouched rat. Next, high throughout RNA-sequencing will be used to examine expression of vomeronasal and olfactory chemical receptors and describe variation by gender, developmental phenotype, or reproductive status suggestive of optimization of sensitivity toward biologically relevant chemical stimuli. This research component will be conducted in collaboration with Sokoine University of Agriculture using animals from natural Tanzanian populations. Lastly, behavioral assays will determine the specific roles of the vomeronasal and main olfactory chemosensory systems, and how these systems interact to facilitate chemical communication and reproduction.

       " '2023274': \"Approximately one quarter of carbon emissions each year is taken up by the worlds’ oceans, which play a critical role in the global carbon cycle. As the oceans continue to respond to climate change, it is important to understand the carbon cycle and how it will change as well. In the surface waters of the ocean, phytoplankton take up carbon through photosynthesis, and a small fraction of this material then sinks to the deeper ocean in a process referred to as the “biological pump.” Current estimates of the global biological pump are similar in size to the amount of global carbon emissions, but uncertainties in these estimates are very large. This project will focus on understanding the role that marine phytoplankton in the North Atlantic Ocean play in the carbon cycle. The project will employ coordinated use of state-of-the-art, remote observational tools, namely biogeochemical profiling floats and ocean color observations from satellites. New techniques will be developed to maximize the information that can be glean from these observations and constrain biological carbon fluxes out of the sunlit upper ocean and through its deeper interior layers over basin-wide, seasonal, and annual scales. Finally, the performance of existing, satellite-based models of these biological fluxes will be evaluated in comparison with analogous estimates made from biogeochemical profiling float data, which can help to fill in satellite observing gaps below the surface and during periods of heavy cloud cover. The proposed effort will provide training and mentorship to a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher. Outreach will be conducted through the 2021 Education And Research: Testing Hypotheses (EARTH) Workshop: A successful, ~15-year collaborative effort between MBARI and the Monterey Bay Aquarium to assist educators with incorporating ocean science information and real-time data into the classroom. To enhance diversity and inclusion in ocean science, a first-generation college student will be selected to participate in the 2021 MBARI Summer Intern Program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Persistent and spatially-distributed in situ observations are needed to develop, and continuously train, more accurate models and remote-sensing algorithms to reduce the uncertainty (currently &gt;100%) in estimates of the biological pump magnitude. The goals of the proposed effort are to develop, implement, and compare robust methods for quantifying biological carbon sequestration by leveraging the complementary information provided by bio-optical and chemical sensors on profiling floats deployed in the North Atlantic Ocean. This project will dovetail with several larger observational programs (EXPORTS, PACE, and pending Global Biogeochemical Argo) and leverage committed NOAA and NASA funding to deploy four biogeochemical profiling floats. Results from the analysis of float data will also be compared with estimates derived from satellite observations to assess the influences of 1) subpolar spring bloom timing and magnitude; and 2) more efficient subtropical carbon export processes, on the amount of carbon annually sequestered by the biological pump. Evaluating carbon production, recycling, and export from different perspectives (e.g., chemical, optical, and remote sensing), will capitalize on the strengths of different sensors and platforms using a combination of standard and novel methods. Quality-control of the data from ~300 existing and four newly deployed profiling floats in the North Atlantic will result in a valuable resource for other investigators.

This level of data quality is attainable only with research ships for the foreseeable future. The U.S. GO-SHIP program is a major contributor to international GO-SHIP, designed to monitor the ocean's response to climate change as part of the World Climate Research Programme’s Global Ocean Observing System. This grant will extend this unique climate data set over the next six years.

However, due to the challenges associated with sampling the deep sea, most studies to date have captured only snapshots of these communities, leaving significant knowledge gaps about how microbes and viruses adapt, evolve, and respond to changes in this environment. The researchers use infrastructure from the Ocean Observatories Initiative to conduct high-resolution monitoring of genetic changes over five years to investigate microbial communities’ function, ecology, and evolution at hydrothermal vents, which are thought to be one of the most ancient habitats on Earth. Data from this project are expected to be a valuable scientific resource for these and other researchers to address future questions.

Hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged in the past decade as a promising low-cost, thin film solar cell with high efficiency and roll-to-roll printing processability, which could encourage a transition into a clean energy economy. However, the use of lead raises the concerns for commercialization because of the potential environmental contamination and human health problems. It is important to carefully find an environmentally benign and efficient replacement for lead with a focus on keeping the excellent properties ascribed to its presence in perovskite materials. Tin perovskite is regarded as an ideal candidate to replace lead perovskite with the theoretical PCE of tin PSCs close to 30% according to Shockley-Queisser limit. Despite progress having been made, the efficiency and stability of tin PSCs are still inferior to their lead counterparts. This project will apply a synergetic approach via materials and interface engineering with the goal to reduce defects, suppress tin oxidization, enhance charge extraction and transport, and reduce energy losses, hence, to increase the efficiency and stability of tin PSCs. Success in this project will advance the knowledge of ionic semiconducting materials and device physics of thin film solar cells, which could lead to a transition into a clean energy economy because of potential commercialization of lead-free, highly efficient and stable PSCs fabricated with low-temperature, large-area, high-throughput processes. Graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will receive training in this highly interdisciplinary research project. The knowledge gained from this work will be disseminated through the workshop that the PI group will offer to the annual event of Expanding Your Horizons at Cornell campus and Ithaca Sciencenter by providing hands-on activities and demonstrations for young students and their families. <br/><br/>The challenge with tin-based PSCs is primarily due to tin-defects, resulting in the undesirable nonradiative recombination of photocarriers and metallic conductivity, and the attendant loss of open-circuit voltage. Additionally, the dangling bonds on the surface and at the grain boundaries introduce trap states, which act as the centers of nonradiative recombination and degradation sites. The research team aims to (1) develop novel Dion-Jacobson (DJ) phase two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D/3D) tin pseudohalide perovskites to reduce tin defects and passivate defects at the grain boundaries and surfaces; (2) synthesize new hole transport materials by introducing functional groups to guide perovskite growth and reduce interface trap states; and (3) deploy new hole and electron transport materials in tin PSCs to increase device efficiency and stability. Forming DJ phase 2D/3D hybrid tin perovskites represents a paradigm shift in tackling the challenge of efficiency and stability of tin-based PSCs. The intellectual merit is driven by our hypotheses: (1) the defects can be significantly reduced and the tin oxidation can be effectively suppressed by adopting large A’-site divalent cations and pseudohalide anions to form 2D/3D bulk and planar heterojunction tin perovskites; and (2) the energy losses can be significantly reduced and the device stability can be greatly enhanced by utilizing newly developed hole and electron transport materials to guide perovskite growth and passivate defects, respectively. By fundamentally understanding the structural and optoelectronic properties of DJ phase 2D/3D tin pseudohalide perovskites, the effect of functionalized hole transport layer on the growth of perovskites, and the non-fullerene acceptor interaction with perovskites, the general principles to guide the development of highly efficient, stable tin PSCs can be elucidated, which could lead to the transformation of clean energy techniques.\\u2003<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

Results will help stakeholders develop and adopt efficient management plans for forest fragments to ensure the protection of chimpanzees and related biodiversity. This project also presents opportunities for training through public outreach and by engaging undergraduate students in field data collection and analyses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will take advantage of two forest fragments which are similar in population density but differ in terms of food abundance and proximity to a larger chimpanzee population. Fragmentation usually co-occurs with substantial loss of food resources, as is the case for one of the forest fragments under investigation. However, the other fragment is still comprised of primary forest, presenting a powerful natural experiment through which to test the effect of fragmentation independent of food availability. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that female behavior will be more impacted by food availability and isolation than fragmentation. Alternatively, female chimpanzees may have sufficient behavioral flexibility due to their fluid social system to mitigate negative consequences of fragmentation. By integrating novel and existing ecological and behavioral datasets, this project will test how habitat fragmentation impacts female chimpanzee subgrouping patterns, dispersal and ultimately, reproductive performance. Subgrouping data will be collected through full day focal follow of adult females and monthly nest surveys along line transects. Female dispersal behavior will be assessed through genetic data, which will be generated from non-invasively collected fecal samples. Finally, female reproductive performance will be characterized from two metrics: the adult female-clinging infant ratio and C-peptide values measured through non-invasively collected urine samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

The project will research and develop an innovative mixed reality (MR) learning environment combining visual displays and a robot with programmable movement. Children in grades K-2 will program the robot to solve path-finding problems. Hints and obstacles in each problem scenario will be presented on a computer tablet. The project environment will be designed mainly for one-on-one use wirelessly and flexibly in either formal or informal settings. Participating children and teachers will be recruited through partnerships with schools in communities that have traditionally been underrepresented in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project design will be grounded in research on embodied cognition, culturally responsive teaching, child development, and human-computer interaction, to develop experiential, inclusive, and playful learning experiences. Three main research questions include 1) what design elements are critical for an effective MR environment? 2) how do children’s positive affect and understanding of sequences and symbols evolve as they participate in the task over time? and 3) what do teachers need to succeed as facilitators? To promote computational thinking skills, children will be engaged in path-finding tasks that will require them to guide a robot to arrive at a destination through the right path. The design of the learning environment and the research will be interwoven in an iterative cycle of design, testing, and development. in addition to traditional data collection methods, sensors will be employed for collection of children’s own movement data. The effectiveness of the environment on learners' understanding and positive affect will be examined by comparing the intervention group with a control group.

Understanding the reliability of self-driving cars is a crucial step to ensuring that the impending ubiquity of self-driving cars causes as few fatalities as possible. Components like actuators, sensors, and computational elements that make up such systems have inherent vulnerabilities to faults due to manufacturing defects, aging, cyberattacks, and environmental factors. Repair and replacement of such components may reduce the risk of fault occurrences, but may be infeasible in terms of cost, safety, and availability. Alternately, certain faults and their false positives may trigger unnecessary repair or cause unnecessary reactions by the vehicle. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly and accurately identify faults in real time. This research will facilitate the development of in-the-field error mitigation techniques, resulting in more reliable autonomous cars. Furthermore, this research will support the technical development and engagement of an underrepresented cohort of graduate and undergraduate students at North Carolina A&T State University and North Carolina Central University through curriculum enhancements and participation in extracurricular activities such as the AutoDrive Challenge, a national self-driving car competition.<br/><br/>The proposed work will provide real-time diagnosis of transient, intermittent, and permanent faults that occur in a self-driving car. This analysis will substantially improve the performance and accuracy of fault classification/identification in complex systems. Multi-perspective error detection techniques, including discrete-event system analysis, data-driven analysis, and chip-level analysis, will be combined to diagnose faults in automotive systems. The discrete-event system analysis will detect and isolate a system's fault occurrences from external observation of general behaviors of the system and in the absence of full observation of occurred events. The data-driven analysis will use a novel fuzzy type-2 clustering-based method to detect whether a fault degraded performance. The chip-level analysis will detect when a computational component is malfunctioning based on equivalence checking of logic signals and state traces. The combination of these approaches will facilitate fault diagnosis of automotive systems in real-time and with greater accuracy and speed. The multi-perspective analysis will improve the understanding of how each perspective interacts with the other and has the potential to identify new fault types and patterns. The enhanced awareness created by integrating these three unique methods will facilitate automotive system fault diagnosis in real time with greater accuracy and speed than could be achieved by any of the methods individually.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

How is memory of cell’s identity safeguarded for an individual’s lifetime? This project uncovers key molecular interaction circuits that enable the same DNA sequence to give rise to distinct and concurrent long-term cellular identities.  This knowledge is valuable to understand diseases linked to loss of cell identity, such as cancer, to educate new approaches to stem cell reprogramming, and, ultimately, to program human cells for cell therapy.   This project involves creating and analyzing mathematical models of molecular circuits that alter DNA compaction. These mathematical models enrich current educational curricula in quantitative molecular biology, systems biology, and synthetic biology. Graduate students receive a highly interdisciplinary training grounded on molecular biology, mathematical modeling, and mathematical theory of stochastic processes. Education aspects of the project impact K-12 and undergraduate students, members of underrepresented groups in science and women in mathematics through outreach and curriculum development activities. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to uncover fundamental principles by which chromatin modification circuits mediate epigenetic cell memory (ECM). ECM is the ability of cells to maintain distinct cell-type-specific gene expression patterns through subsequent cell divisions without a change in genetic sequence. The key hypothesis of this project is that synergistic positive feedback loops within chromatin modification circuits govern ECM in combination with time scale separation between epigenetic erasure and read-write processes. To validate this hypothesis, this project follows a “build-to-understand” approach driven by rigorous mathematical analysis of the (quasi)-stationary probability distribution of new multi-time scale stochastic processes. These processes naturally arise from the dynamics of chromatin modification circuits and take the form of small perturbations of non-ergodic processes, that capture time scale separation. The project has three aims. Aim 1 and Aim 2 focus on a single gene’s chromatin modification circuit, identifies biochemical parameters that control time scale separation, and establish an experimental model system to tune them. Aim 2 is focused on the extent to which DNA methylation biases ECM towards a repressed chromatin state and proposes a positive autoregulation mechanism to enhance ECM of an active chromatin state. Aim 3 investigates how, by wiring multiple genes’ chromatin modification circuits together, a long-term memory of arbitrary gene expression patterns could be created. As a proof of principle, Aim 3 performs experiments on an epigenetic toggle switch test-bed, a motif highly represented in gene regulatory networks involved in cell fate determination, in which two gene mutually repress each other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology and Genetic Mechanisms clusters in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Mathematical Biology program in the Division of Mathematics and the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

The NSF-funded National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a continental-scale ecological observation facility that collects and provides quality-controlled data from 81 field sites across the United States that characterize and quantify how our nation's ecosystems are changing. NEON's measurements of plant photosynthesis and respiration are providing the data needed for computer projections of continental scale patterns, year-to-year variations, and trends in the global carbon cycle. This project will develop more refined continental-scale carbon profiles by using a novel approach to improve complex computer models and delivering a widely-sought application of NEON data. The investigators will broaden impacts of this project by providing training to early-career scientists, broadening diversity, sharing products with the research community, and enhancing research and education infrastructure. The results are anticipated to be of high value for integrated assessments of global change and will be useful for federal, state and local agencies, and land managers who are making decisions on managing U.S. natural resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will constrain the continental-scale terrestrial carbon cycle by integrating observations from NEON, satellite data, data-driven methods, and data-model integration techniques.

First, the investigators will utilize NEON data to develop an hourly, gridded Gross Primary Production(GPP) product with uncertainty estimates based on satellite observations and meteorological data. Second, they will use NEON data along with solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data from satellites to develop gridded complimentary GPP products with uncertainty estimates. Third, they will utilize multiple heterogeneous datasets from NEON and the gridded GPP products for quantifying the US land carbon sink potential and assess the effectiveness of NEON data to constrain parameter estimation and model prediction. Fourth, they will develop a multiple model ensemble to understand constraints of flux- vs. pool-based data on structure uncertainty in model prediction. Fifth, they will apply data assimilation techniques to quantify parameter uncertainty and assess constraints of multiple vs. single NEON data sets on parameter estimation with three different models.

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has proven remarkably successful at describing the interactions of the known fundamental particles for the past 50 years.  However, the SM is known to be incomplete, and there are compelling reasons to expect that the SM will eventually fail to describe some observed properties of matter.  To address the question of whether there is new physics beyond the Standard Model, a precision measurement of the weak charge of the electron will be performed in a collaborative experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia.  The electron’s weak charge is the weak force analog of the common electric charge of the electron, and it is precisely predicted in the SM.  Any deviation of the measurement from this prediction would be evidence for undiscovered phenomena that represent new physics beyond our current understanding.  The experiment is named MOLLER and it comprises a range of hardware design and construction activities as well as software development which will provide excellent training for students and young scientists. The experience of working in a collaborative modern science enterprise with state of the art technology provides a strong basis for a variety of careers.<br/><br/>The funds provided by this project will support construction of essential apparatus for the MOLLER experiment (Measurement of a Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction) at Jefferson Lab. MOLLER will measure the electron’s neutral weak charge by making a precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons on unpolarized electrons at very low momentum transfer.  This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders, providing excellent sensitivity to physics scenarios that extend beyond the Standard Model.  The MOLLER experiment consists of three major subsystems: 1) the beam/target/spectrometer to prepare the scattered Møller electrons to be observed, 2) apparatus to measure the raw parity-violating asymmetry to the needed statistical precision, and 3) apparatus for Normalization and Systematic Control to achieve sub-ppb and sub-% level systematic uncertainty and normalization control goals.

This strategy often stretches the limits of what can currently be done via geometric analysis, and simultaneously leads to new insights into these physics conjectures.

A second goal is to verify a similar conjectural description of hyperkaehler metrics on elliptically-fibered K3 surfaces by the physicists Kachru, Tripathy, and Zimet. The Hitchin moduli spaces and elliptically-fibered K3 surfaces are both algebraic completely integrable systems admitting a hyperkaehler metric. Both are fibered over a half-dimensional base and the generic fibers are abelian varieties. Some fibers are singular, and these conjectures are most interesting and most difficult near these singular fibers.

High precision, high accuracy heat capacity measurements will be made to quantify the solid and liquid states, and their dependence upon bound water and salt content. Specifically, the role of LiCl salt will be investigated as to its impact on the thermal and structural properties of PZIs. Temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry will be performed on PZI cast films to provide fundamental thermal properties such as the solid state heat capacity. Differential fast scanning chip calorimetry will be used to study these materials at 2000 K/s to avoid degradation, to obtain the dry-state glass transition temperature, liquid-state heat capacity, and heat capacity increment at the glass transition.

Much less attention has been given to the ways students’ internal values guide their professional conduct or how these values affect their attraction to and training within a STEM discipline. This has limited the development of ethical training protocols combining internal and external factors in cultivating ethically literate students and institutional cultures. Led by an interdisciplinary team at a 21st century research-intensive, Hispanic-serving institution, this project generates fundamental understanding about how the intersection of the implicit values that guide individuals and the explicit content and experiences of ethics education and training matter for ethical reasoning. Practically, the project develops methods for understanding the ways students negotiate personal values and reason ethically amid the disciplinary enculturation process, which is especially crucial to increasing and retaining diverse perspectives within STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project employs surveys of undergraduates and graduate students, linguistic coding and keyword analysis of professional ethics codes and curriculum modules, and correspondence analysis of qualitative data collected from workshops, focus groups, and interviews to investigate ethical reasoning among STEM students. It has three main objectives: (1) identify the extent to which individual values correlate with demographic differences and disciplinary choices, (2) analyze explicit ethical frameworks within and across STEM student experiences, and (3) understand intersections among internal values and formal ethical frameworks and how they affect disciplinary enculturation and ethical reasoning. Individual values and their demographic correlates are examined by administering the Moral Foundations Questionnaire to students in a mix of traditional and interdisciplinary STEM programs. The formal ethical training students receive is analyzed by applying linguistic coding and keyword analysis to ethics codes from professional bodies, curriculum modules, and other sources of ethics experience. Intersections between individual ethics and formal ethical training are studied by using correspondence analysis to analyze participant data collected through PI-led ethics workshops, focus groups, and individual interviews with a representative sample of student participants. Analyses will focus on whether and to what extent personal values map onto disciplinary values and the ways values are negotiated and established.

Subduction has many important human impacts, especially hazards from seismic and volcanic activity that are a constant threat to population centers and commerce worldwide. Subduction also plays a key role in shaping the earth's surface and is important in the formation of continents and the mineral resources they contain. As a result, subduction-related processes are the subject of broad public and scientific interest. The key goal of this work is to understand how fluids (superheated water at high pressures) drive subduction magmatism, which is manifest in volcanoes at the earth’s surface. Under this project, chemical data will be collected on volcanic rocks of the Aleutian Island Arc. Data collection will focus on the elements boron (B) and molybdenum (Mo), which are relatively water-soluble in earth-surface systems, and as a result, are abundant in seawater and are easily transferred to rocks that underlie the ocean basins. When subduction pushes the hydrated oceanic crust back into the Earth’s interior, the water is driven out of the rocks by chemical reactions that produce fluids rich in B and Mo. Under the extreme pressures and temperatures of the Earth’s interior, fluids lower the melting point of the rocks that they encounter and trigger the melting processes that lead to volcanic eruptions at the Earth’s surface. In turn, the concentrations of B and Mo in these volcanic rocks reveal key information about the paths that the fluids follow and the rocks that are melted along the way. Immediate societal benefit of this work will be research training of the graduate students who will be supported under the project.

We will collect B and Mo isotope data for subduction inputs (sediment, altered oceanic crust, abyssal peridotite) and outputs (volcanic rocks) along the Aleutian arc and link the chemical results to physical parameters such as subduction rate, sediment flux, and thermal parameter, which change systematically along the arc. Boron isotopes are used as tracers of fluid pathways, which also respond to changes in the thermal state of the subducting plate. The importance of Mo isotopes stems from their value as a tracer of both fluids and sediment type. The combined B and Mo isotope tracers and Aleutian natural laboratory create opportunities to distinguish sources in subducted sediment, serpentinite, and altered oceanic crust, especially at the point along the arc where the Amlia Fracture Zone enters the trench, and in the western-most Aleutians, where hot-slab effects are uniquely well expressed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

The first step in the pathway will be a redesigned Introduction to Statistics course that incorporates project-based learning.  This change is expected to engage more students and spark their interest in pursuing a STEM pathway.   The next step in the pathway will be a new introduction to Data Science course, which will meet a transfer math requirement  The Data Science course is expected to serve as an onramp into STEM for students who do not necessarily see themselves in a STEM career.  The project will actively recruit students from the new statistics course into the new Data Science course, thus transforming the statistics course into a STEM talent pipeline instead of a terminal math course.  Additional students will be recruited into the Data Science course via a new Data Scholars Program, which will provide a supportive STEM community for students who may not be initially interested in STEM majors.  Finally, the project will provide professional development to mathematics faculty on implementing project-based curriculum pedagogy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quasi-experimental design will be used to measure the overall effectiveness of project-based learning in the introductory statistics course. Students in the new project-based learning statistics course will be compared with students in statistics courses using traditional pedagogy. Analysis of variance will be used to examine differences between the two types of courses on measures of student experience, student attendance, course success, degree completion, and transfer rate to four-year universities. Furthermore, qualitative methods, such as focus groups and open-ended survey questions, will be used to evaluate the fidelity of implementing the project-based learning model. This project project may serve as a model for other community colleges looking to build a data science program and a new pathway into STEM. Lessons learned and insights gained into how changing pedagogy impacts student interest and success in STEM will be shared through conference presentations and publications. Anticipated outcomes during the project period include increased student success rates in the project-based statistics course, increased enrollment in the data science course, and increased participation in the Data Scholars program.

       " '2019117': \"Increased productivity and economic growth partly depends on adoption of improved technology which in turn depends on the transmission of information about new technologies.  Young people tend to learn about new technologies before their parents who own productive resources and are wedded to old technologies and may not trust the new information they learn from the young.  On the other hand, young people may mistrust elders and may not reveal appropriate information they think elders will not accept, thus slowing technical progress and economic growth.  This research project will use theory and experiments to study how social norms affect the intergenerational flow of technological information and how best to solve this friction in information flow.  In addition to intergenerational transmission of information, the research also studies whether there is a gender dimension to the intergenerational flow of technological information.  The results of this study could influence the design of effective information interventions that induce intergenerational flows of knowledge to speed up technical progress. The results will offer valuable information on the constraints in the economic empowerment of young women. The results of this research has the potential to increase the pace of innovation and accelerate economic growth, and improve the living standards of Americans.    &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research project will leverage a collaboration with NGO partners in 150 junior high schools to study the barriers in intergenerational flow of knowledge. The project focuses on beliefs held by parents regarding the level and relevance of students’ school-taught technical  knowledge, as well as students’ assessments of parents’ beliefs. It examines whether parents and students hold systematically biased beliefs; relates these biases to conventional roles prescribed for different configurations of parents and students by gender; and measures the effects of beliefs on intergenerational communication patterns, parents’ acquisition of new technical knowledge, and the empowerment of youth. The research proceeds in four stages. First, a baseline survey will collect household demographics of participants in a school-based technical education program. Second, the PIs will elicit parents’ and students’ beliefs in interviews; and deliver technical information to a random subset of parents and students. Third, the PIs will survey  productive inputs allocated to youth for their home production, the acquisition of new technical knowledge among parents as well as communication patterns between students and parents. Finally, the study will track the impact of the information interventions on production patterns after two school years.

       " '2001980': \"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Human Resource Development contribute funds to this award. It supports fundamental theoretical and computational research and education involving the study of electrons confined to two dimensions and subject to interactions and crystal environments that lead to a preferred direction.<br/><br/>Atoms and molecules are made of elementary particles such as electrons, protons, and neutrons. Electrons are often tightly bound to their atoms. Materials are made of many billions of atoms, and in metals and semiconductor materials some electrons can move relatively freely. These electrons can behave like a liquid and can easily respond to externally applied fields, such as electric fields, magnetic fields, and applied pressure. For example, a copper wire conducts electricity in response to an applied electric field.<br/><br/>Since many interesting properties of materials are determined by the behavior of such free electrons, it is natural to study the nature of the possible states of electronic matter that arise in large systems of electrons and the dependence of their properties on external parameters, such as temperature, electron density, and applied magnetic field. The PI will study electronic states in materials where free electrons are restricted to two-dimensions where the interaction between electrons and quantum effects may combine leading to new phenomena and new electronic states of matter. The electrons may be in a uniform liquid state of matter if interactions are not very strong. The properties of such a liquid state would be isotropic - the same in all directions. However, it is possible that effective interactions between electrons are anisotropic or direction dependent. The presence of the crystalline lattice of atoms makes electrons behave as though they have an effective mass that can depend on the direction of their motion. This may lead to electrons behaving like a liquid of elongated rods leading to electronic states analogous to those assumed by the rod-like molecules in a liquid crystal display. The PI will investigate electronic states that may arise as a consequence of anisotropy. This includes externally induced anisotropy, such as the anisotropic states that could arise under the application of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the 2D world of the electrons. The investigation of new electronic states adds to the intellectual foundations that lead to new electronic device technologies. <br/><br/>The research activities conducted in this project will lead to research opportunities for economically challenged students in the setting of a HBCU, will enhance research and education in an undergraduate environment, and will improve the preparation of undergraduate students for graduate studies. Overall, this project will help to enhance the research and the education infrastructure at the local institution, and lead to broader participation of underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Human Resource Development contribute funds to this award. It supports fundamental theoretical and computational research to investigate the emergence of novel anisotropic exotic quantum liquid phases in strongly correlated Fermi systems. The PI will study two-dimensional systems of electrons in the quantum Hall regime and two-dimensional Fermi liquid phases with deformed Fermi surfaces in presence of some internal degree of anisotropy. The PI aims to understand how anisotropic electronic ordered states arise in various quantum phases in response to intrinsic anisotropy of the system. The PI will also investigate the nature of novel exotic anisotropic phases such as anisotropic quantum Hall liquid phases driven by an anisotropic interaction potential and anisotropic Fermi liquid phases with deformed Fermi surfaces driven by a combination of anisotropic effective mass and an anisotropic interaction potential between electrons.<br/><br/>The theoretical approaches can be applied to experiments on two-dimensional electron systems with strong mass anisotropy where unusual anisotropic transport in the quantum Hall regime is anticipated. The ideas of this research can be relevant to understand experiments in two-dimensional systems of electrons confined in aluminum arsenide quantum wells and related systems. The electron effective mass anisotropy ratios can be almost one order of magnitude in these systems. Of particular interest is how tuning piezoelectric properties effects the anisotropic effective electron interactions, and the resulting experimentally observable consequences.  Experiments may be proposed to detect signatures in transport properties resulting from the interplay of different sources of anisotropy. The PI will consider other physical systems as well, including ultracold atoms in anisotropic lattice traps. <br/><br/>The PI and his team will use a combination of theoretical and computational methods, including exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo, to carry out the research. Students will use methods suited to their skills, such as variational or perturbation methods from quantum theory, or computer simulations, in order to enhance their educational experience as appropriate. The research provides a setting for education and mentoring to enhance interest in science and leading careers in STEM. This project will help broaden participation of minority and economically challenged students in science and engineering through enhancing the pipeline.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2040076': \"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to define the requirements for the development of natural polysaccharide (sugar)-based gel devices for bone healing. There has been a recent, sharp increase in the number of orthopedic surgeries worldwide; This is due to the increased aging population with orthopedic diseases and the rising incidence of road accidents. In addition, the increased number of obesity and osteoporosis patients are accompanied with high incidence of bone fracture. Currently available treatments including autografts, allografts, bone graft substitutes (BGSs), and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) suffer from many drawbacks. The proposed gel consists of a natural polysaccharide that as been shown to promote rapid bone growth through osteoconductive and vascularizing effects. In addition, an associated anti-bacterial property is considered an important advantage as more than 70% of patients with fractures in distal extremities suffer from infection that requires treatment. The translation of the proposed gel device is expected to help the patients recover faster without infection. In addition, the treatment may be more cost-effective than the BGSs and BMPs available in the market. The global market is estimated to be the $3.25 billion for treating fractures in distal extremities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the translation of developments for natural polysaccharide gel devices for bone healing. The device consists of gellan gum and FDA-approved components that demonstrate strong osteoconductive and angiogenetic activities for rapid bone healing with anti-bacterial effects. The current treatments for bone defects are autografts, allografts, bone graft substitutes (BGSs), and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). These methods often suffer from problems such as immuno-rejection, disease transmission, weak bone-forming potency, abnormal bone outgrowth, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. In a recent animal study with the proposed gel, it was found that the gel induced significant cortical bone ingrowth and thickened cortical bones at the injection sites. In addition, there was a significant increase in neovascularization within the cortical bones. Two major advantages of the device over the current bone healing devices available in the market are its ability to induce bone growth inwardly and suppress tumorous cell growth. Additionally, the anti-bacterial activity of the device is an improvement because bone fracture-related infection delays healing and increases complications and medical costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

This project intends to build capacity to create a pathway from high school to science or mathematics teacher certification with a focus on students in rural locales. This project will serve national interest and the Noyce program’s intent through implementing an asset-based approach that builds upon the strengths of a rural community in the recruitment and mentoring of students to fill much needed positions in STEM teaching. Significant to this project is the identification of how the unique strengths of a rural region can be leveraged to create a pathway for students from high school to STEM teacher licensure. This is important because rural regions across the nation are struggling with recruiting and retaining high quality STEM teachers. This project proposes to both capitalize on the strengths of the local community and to implement a series of steps towards the creation of a pathway to recruit, mentor, and prepare STEM students for teacher certification. This includes working with the local community, the newly aligned two-year college branch campuses that tend to serve primarily low-income students, and high school students’ own enthusiasm for mathematics and science. This project has the potential to provide useful information on a different, more direct approach for recruiting students along with how to create a pathway from high school to STEM teacher certification to address the need for more high-quality science and mathematics teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Capacity Building project at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, a comprehensive public institution, is in partnership with its two 2-year branch campuses, UW-Platteville Baraboo Sauk County and UW-Platteville Richmond. The project’s overarching goal is to create a “grow-your-own” program, designed to recruit promising high school seniors, and to then provide innovative, continual support as they travel on the path to becoming highly-qualified high school STEM educators. The project will achieve this by building partnerships, creating a cohort-centered mentoring program, and systematically gathering and analyzing data. The project’s intellectual merit includes the use of an asset model approach to leverage the strengths of a rural community in the recruiting and supporting of STEM students seeking education licensing. The project’s broader impacts will provide other institutions, particularly those in a dynamic post-secondary state system, the steps necessary for creating a pathway that eases rural students’ transition from high school, to a two-year institution, to a four-year institution, then to the classroom as high-quality, licensed science or mathematics teachers. The work will be evaluated by examining the effectiveness of the proposed Capacity Building approach that leads to the creation and submission of a future Noyce proposal. The findings will be disseminated through established regional and national networks focused on improving science and mathematics K-12 teachers.

Second, the project will investigate the interactions among different parties in the AI service ecosystem from an economics perspective, and will devise incentive mechanisms towards superior resource utilization and optimal social welfare with desired economic properties. Third, the project will conduct a combination of simulations, measurements, and implementations with real-world data traces and realistic experimental settings to comprehensively evaluate and validate the models, algorithms, and systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will impact the industry by providing telecom carriers, network operators, and service providers with a critical set of techniques to enable them to provision and operate dedicated or value-added edge-AI services upon distributed infrastructures.

PEC water splitting is a process which involves generation of charge carriers (electrons and holes) by solar radiation and their transfer to respective electrodes to produce H2 and O2. However, charge separation and transportation are the major concerns in PEC water splitting. Here we propose to develop a novel and highly efficient PEC water splitting nanocatalyst, by carefully growing a PEC-efficient catalyst with a suitable band width nanomaterial on a three-dimensional nanographene scaffold via a convenient one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. This novel nanocatalyst can achieve high surface to volume ratio which therefore facilitates charge separation and suppress electron-hole pair recombination. In addition, the desired PEC catalyst’s band width can be realized by controlling its size and morphology. Optimum conditions for synthesizing the desired nanostructures will be established to maximize the water-splitting efficiency.

CSH has high strength under compression, but is significantly weaker under bending and has low fracture toughness. The irregular and random nature of the nanostructure of CSH is responsible for its brittle nature. This research will innovate new CSH nanostructures that are inspired by the unique architecture of nacre, which is ultra-lightweight and recognized as one of the strongest biomaterials. The growth of natural nacre will be mimicked to synthesize CSH with polymers and organics to form highly ordered nacre-like architectures. This research will create novel cement-based materials with crack resistance as high as that of natural nacre, which will tremendously enhance the resilience, sustainability, and durability of civil engineering structures (such as prefabricated walls and panels of buildings, linings of tunnels or pipelines, and permanent formwork of bridges), energy infrastructure (such as  solar panels, offshore wind farms), aerospace structures and others. The education and outreach activities of this project will engage and create opportunities for K-12 students and underrepresented minorities in STEM disciplines to learn about biomimetic materials and structures in engineering. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to demonstrate the hypothesis that CSH nacre architecture can be synthesized to achieve high specific flexural strength and fracture toughness through a consecutive assembly-and-mineralization process mimicking the growth of natural nacre. The main objectives of this research are to: (i) develop methods to synthesize and control growth of CSH mesocrystals; (ii) develop a consecutive assembly-mineralization process for scalable fabrication of CSH nacre; (iii) characterize mechanical properties of the synthetic CSH nacre; and (iv) establish links for the fabrication process, microstructure, and mechanical properties to optimize the CSH nacre. To this end, a scaffold will first be fabricated by freeze casting and followed by nucleation and growth of CSH mesocrystals on the scaffold through controlled mineralization; then, laminated CSH nacre will be synthesized through organic phase infiltration and hot-pressing.

This project studies how processes in the critical zone respond to changes in the environment. Data are collected from five watersheds in Colorado and California. The project links the fields of water science, forest ecology, rock chemistry and soil chemistry. The project connects the way water moves and is stored in the ground to how trees grow and to how soil and rocks change. Studying these interactions is important to understanding how Earth will respond to future changes in climate. Researchers from six universities work together. Students are trained in several areas of Earth science. Educational materials are developed for all grade levels including K-12 and college. <br/><br/>The Earth’s critical zone is defined as the upper layer of the Earth’s surface, from bedrock to the tree canopy, and is dependent upon the co-evolution of Earth system processes including interactions among climate, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and geology. Despite the fundamental importance of water in critical zone processes, there is not widespread understanding of the relations between how water is stored in the critical zone and how it affects key processes, or how global change drivers, such as climate shifts and disturbance, will modify these interactions. The goals of this critical zone network cluster are to 1) advance understanding of the interactions among water storage, critical zone processes, and water provisioning in the complex physiography of western United States montane ecosystems; 2) explore how water storage and critical zone processes will be altered under global change drivers; and 3) create educational opportunities and resources about the critical zone that are accessible to a diverse student population, including K-12 to postgraduates.

       " '2033926': \"The unprecedented and fast evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted STEM education, negatively impacting students’ persistence and success. Social aspects of race and class predict health and education outcomes.  Public health crises, like COVID-19, disproportionately impact African Americans (AAs), lower income Americans, and individuals with psychosocial risk factors. This disparate impact has been linked to poor baseline health and environmental factors that make it difficult to adhere to social distancing orders. National education-related disparities show similar patterns across sociodemographic groups. Low-income college students have unequal access to computers, electronic devices, and internet service. They also encounter, higher instances of barriers, such as family violence and hunger, and greater concerns around stress and coping. At North Carolina A&amp;T State University (NC A&amp;T), the nation’s largest Historically Black College and University (HBCU), over 1,700 students failed to show up for classes when COVID-19 forced transition of all classes to online instruction modes in March 2020, placing them at risk for dropping out of college or extending their time in school; an additional financial burden. Furthermore, many of the students at HBCUs work part-time while attending school, mostly in the essential services sector. This places them at greater risk for exposure to COVID-19, exacerbating their anxieties and stress levels. A multidisciplinary team of investigators from NC A&amp;T seeks to understand the risk factors for these college students and use the information to develop effective interventions to prevent disruptions in remote learning success in preparation for fall 2020 and subsequent semesters. This is critical because resumption of classes using “normal” face-to-face formats is unlikely to happen until a drug or vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, a scenario that could take years. If the barriers to online and remote learning are not addressed, these students will literally be left behind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study seeks to highlight the extent to which psychosocial risk factors, including poor access to technology resources, related to the current COVID-19 pandemic and extenuating circumstances are having an impact on student learning outcomes. To better understand the correlations between psychosocial risk factors and remote learning success in times of crisis, this study will utilize a mixed-methods approach for students at NC A&amp;T. An online survey will be administered to collect data on various metrics: sociodemographic characteristics, experience with COVID-19, attitudes and behaviors in response to COVID-19, perceived stress and coping, depression, family violence perpetration and victimization, food insecurity and self-efficacy, and familiarity with computers and technology. This will be followed by interviews with randomly selected survey respondents to contextualize quantitative findings and uncover additional barriers and promoters. Survey data will be analyzed using regression modeling, and interview data will be analyzed using content analyses. The survey and interview data will be triangulated by comparing and contrasting findings to develop a comprehensive understanding of psychosocial risk factors that impact remote learning success. The outcomes will inform development of a mobile Application (App) to engage these students and connect them to resources needed to sustain their learning in these disruptive conditions. Findings from this study will produce new knowledge regarding psychosocial determinants of successful remote learning during a critical disruption in the academic journey. As the nation’s largest HBCU and top producer of African American STEM undergraduates, NC A&amp;T is positioned to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted vulnerable students and develop suitable interventions for academic success. This work will inform future policy and development of prevention strategies so that institutions are better prepared for future pandemics that make remote and online learning necessary for all students. This work will produce insights that may be applied more generally to how HBCU students’ and students from similar backgrounds transition to online learning. This research will aid intervention development by identifying factors impacting student success under extreme disruptive conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2042107': \"This collaborative research investigates the strong coupling between floating particles at the air-water interface and water waves, which is a fundamental scientific problem with inspiration for technological innovation. The water surface in nature attracts all sorts of objects, such as biological organisms in search of food and mates, as well as microplastics and oil spills polluting the world's oceans and lakes. Thus, the water surface provides an important opportunity to survey the local ecology and clean the pollutants if one can identify and control these objects on-demand. The outcomes of this project will provide fundamental understanding of physical mechanisms necessary for such applications, which range from locating floating objects in darkness for search and surveillance missions, to collecting marine debris for environmental protection. In addition, the PIs will participate in various educational activities at their home institutions with a focus on recruiting students from under-represented groups. The students participating in this research will be trained in both experimental and theoretical approaches and will engage in active collaboration across institutes through co-advising, virtual group meetings, and presentations. <br/><br/>The overall objective of this collaborative research is to gain fundamental understanding of rich dynamical interactions that arise between the floating objects, surface waves and fluid flows. Specifically, the PI team will uncover complex particle-wave interactions in the context of sensing and controlling objects at the fluid-fluid interface. There are different types of hydrodynamic interactions that dominate depending on the relevant length scale of the system. For example, wave dispersion and particle movement on a thin liquid layer are governed by capillary and viscous forces, while the wave-particle dynamics on the deep water surface is governed primarily by inertia and gravity. However, there is no comprehensive framework at present that can resolve the coupled dynamics of the surface waves and particles at the interface across different scales. By combining experiments and mathematical modeling, the four PIs will investigate the fundamentals of wave-particle interactions: sensing (scattered waves) and actuation (force and torque) of floating objects remotely, in the distinct limits of shallow and deep water waves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2008768': \"This project addresses the fundamental problem of motion planning in robotics and related problems in Computational Geometry.  There are three general approaches to robot motion planning: exact, sampling and subdivision. Exact Methods give the strongest guarantees of reliability, but exact algorithms are often unavailable or hard to implement. Roboticists today favor Sampling Methods, but these methods have difficulty in finding paths in narrow passages or in halting when there is no path.  Subdivision Methods can overcome this halting problem, and can be as practical and efficient as Sampling Methods. However, Subdivision Methods today lack a clear foundation and non-trivial complexity analysis. This project develops a novel theory of Subdivision Methods in motion planning to provide both.  The theory paves the way for a new class of efficient, practical and flexible path planners. These algorithms are validated by implementations and empirical comparisons with state-of-the-art path planners. Taking a leaf from the highly successful Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) framework of the Sampling Methods, the researchers of this project formulate a similar framework called Soft Subdivision Search (SSS) for their new algorithms.  The framework has several plug-and-play modules such as a search strategy and two primitives to split and classify subdivision boxes. The framework allows experimentation with a wide variety of algorithms, and is implemented in the research team's open source Core Library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new theory of Subdivision Methods is based upon the twin foundations of resolution-exactness and soft predicates. Resolution-exactness is a principled response to the halting problem, and matches the needs of robotic systems with inherent uncertainties. Soft predicates are easy to implement correctly using interval methods and numerical approximation, and avoid the difficulties of exact algorithms.  The complexity analysis of (adaptive) subdivision algorithms is a current challenge, which the research team addresses using the technique called continuous amortization. The theory extends and applies to many problems in Computational Geometry. It provides solutions where exact algorithms are currently non-existent (e.g., Voronoi-diagram construction of polyhedral objects) or impractical (e.g., Minkowski sum of polyhedra). Another significant direction is to introduce the subdivision framework in the external memory (or out-of-core) setting to reduce the I/O bottleneck when the input data is too large to fit in main memory. Such algorithms are critical in many big data applications.  Overall, this project has the following potential impact. Practical and reliable planning algorithms will speed up the deployment of robot technology. Resolution-exactness provides the necessary safety factor as robots are employed in human environments and used in mission-critical applications like surgery. The ideas of soft primitives have broad implications for Computational Geometry. They allow computational geometers to attack continuous problems in Computational Science and Engineering (CS&amp;E) where exact methods either do not exist or are unknown. The out-of-core extension enables these algorithms to cover the entire spectrum of the input sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

Over the last few years, computational hardware has become commercially available that promises to take full advantage of quantum supremacy. However, none of the available systems is readily useful for practical application, since the hardware is still prone to decoherence and the limitations of linear quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>The prevailing theory for studying effects of thermal noise in quantum systems is Quantum Thermodynamics. This emerging field has already delivered insights and results of practical consequence for the design of quantum computers. While most previous research has focused exclusively on linear systems, nonlinear quantum systems in photonic or ultracold atom gases exhibit unique and powerful capabilities for computing. However, to design efficient quantum computers, one has to understand the thermodynamics of the underlying material, since writing as well as erasing comes at the expense of thermodynamic work (Landauer's principle). To date, the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of nonlinear systems has been understood only at a rudimentary level. Therefore, this project will extend the scope of stochastic thermodynamics to nonlinear quantum systems.<br/><br/>This project will help lay the groundwork for 21st-century information technology. By investigating the ultimate physical limits and tradeoffs of computation, it will help develop the theoretical foundation essential for constructing post-Moore's-Law computer architectures and contribute to future engineering and manufacturing of energy-efficient computer architectures.  To achieve these impacts, the project will involve graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge research, preparing the nation's next generation of scientists.<br/><br/><br/>Technical summary<br/><br/>Scientific efforts in classical as well as quantum stochastic thermodynamics have focused on the description of so-called information engines, which also have been realized experimentally. An information engine is a thermodynamic device that operates by processing information and can thus be considered the thermodynamic paradigm for any (quantum) computer.<br/><br/>The project will contribute to this dynamic field of research by generalizing the theory of quantum stochastic thermodynamics to nonlinear systems. This research is of topical interest, since to build a quantum computer in a nonlinear quantum system, one must understand the interplay of information and entropy production. To achieve this goal, the project will focus on three main topics: generalizing fundamental notions of work, heat, and entropy production at the nanoscale from linear to nonlinear quantum mechanics, studying the interplay of (quantum) information and (quantum) thermodynamics, and generalizing the quantum speed limit and its applications in order to identify optimal quantum processes with minimal dissipation or maximally fast information processing.<br/><br/>In particular, this project will aim at (i) the numerical study of the quantum speed limit, i.e., the maximal rate with which a quantum state can evolve under nonlinear dynamics; (ii) the development of a consistent framework for stochastic thermodynamics in nonlinear quantum systems, comprising the identification and study of entropy and information production, and the derivation of generalized fluctuation theorems; (iii) the theoretical study and design of minimal, yet self-contained, quantum information engines, which optimally exploit computational advantages arising from nonlinear dynamics; and (iv) the development of a conceptual framework and the design of experiments for quantum information engines in Bose-Einstein condensates.<br/><br/>The results could impact the design of quantum computers and the fundamental understanding of quantum nanotechnology.  Moreover, this research will open new avenues for the understanding of time-dependent quantum-information-processing systems operating arbitrarily far from thermal equilibrium.  Finally, the proposed research is also of basic theoretical interest, since the methodology, including quantum optics and quantum optimal control theory, provides conceptually simple models and tools to describe nano-devices subjected to both thermal and quantum fluctuations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

Such programming languages are widely used in the World Wide Web (WWW), such as Web browser extensions, server-side Node.js applications, and client-side scripting. While they are popular and successful to improve the Web with abundant new functionalities, at the same time, prototype-based languages also introduce new types of object-related vulnerabilities. Examples of such object-related vulnerabilities on the Web are like prototype pollution that pollutes an object property via the prototypical chain, and internal property tampering that tampers an internal property of Web application objects. State-of-the-art works adopt graph-based structures, such as Control-flow Graph, Data-flow Graph and Code Property Graph, to represent target computer programs and efficiently mine vulnerabilities in languages like C/C++ and PHP.

The abstract interpretation will generate a special graph structure, called Object Property Graph, to represent JavaScript objects, scopes, and variables as nodes and their relations as edges. The advantage of Object Property Graph is that it can efficiently find the definition and use of certain objects via Abstract Syntax Tree and all the properties of a given object.  Furthermore, the proposed Object Property Graph will be used to not only detect and exploit JavaScript vulnerabilities but also guide the generation of additional JavaScript code with object-related properties to trigger low-level vulnerabilities in JavaScript engine.

Both systems will make decisions based on inputs from a combination of simple, single output sensing devices, such as inertial measurement units, and complex, high dimensional output sensing modalities, such as cameras and LiDAR.  This shift from relying only on simple, single output sensing devices to systems that incorporate rich, complex perceptual sensing modalities requires rethinking the design of safety-critical autonomous systems, especially given the inextricable role that machine and deep learning play in the design of modern perceptual sensors.  These two motivating examples raise an even more fundamental question however: given the vastly different dynamics, environments, objectives, and safety/risk constraints, should these two systems have perceptual sensors with different properties?  Indeed, due to the extremely safety critical nature of the bomb defusing task, an emphasis on robustness, risk aversion, and safety seems necessary.  Conversely, the designer of the drone racer may be willing to sacrifice robustness to maximize responsiveness and lower lap-time.  This extreme diversity in requirements highlights the need for a principled approach to navigate tradeoffs in this complex design space, which is what this proposal seeks to develop.  Existing approaches to designing perception/action pipelines are either modular, which often ignore uncertainty and limit interaction between components, or monolithic and end-to-end, which are difficult to interpret, troubleshoot, and have high sample-complexity. <br/><br/>This project proposes an alternative approach and rethinks the scientific foundations of using machine learning and computer vision to process rich high-dimensional perceptual data for use in safety-critical cyber-physical control applications.  Thrusts will develop integration between perception, planning and control that allow for their co-design and co-optimization.  Using novel robust learning methods for perceptual representations and predictive models that characterize tradeoffs between robustness (e.g., to lighting & weather changes, rotations) and performance (e.g., responsiveness, discriminativeness), jointly learned perception maps and uncertainty profiles will be abstracted as ``noisy virtual sensors” for use in uncertainty aware perception-based planning & control algorithms with stability, performance, and safety guarantees.  These insights will be integrated into novel perception-based model predictive control algorithms, which allow for planning, stability, and safety guarantees through a unifying optimization-based framework acting on rich perceptual data.  Experimental validation of the benefits of these methods will be conducted at Penn using photorealistic simulations and physical camera equipped quadcopters, and be used to demonstrate perception-based planning and control algorithms at the extremes of speed/safety tradeoffs.   On the educational front, the research outcomes of this proposal will be used to develop a sequence of courses on safe autonomy, safe perception, and learning and control at the University of Pennsylvania. Longer term, the goal of this project is to create a new community of researchers that focus on robust learning for perception-based control.

This including modeling system energetics, stability, and control; developing predictive principles and dynamic models; clinical evaluation and gait recovery for healthy and stroke, amputee, osteoarthritic, or other limited-mobility patients; analyzing empirical data in a conceptual framework; as well as design and evaluation of robots, prosthetics, and exoskeletons. Topics central to dynamic walking include energetics, stability and control, predictive principles and models, dynamic modeling, empirical data in a conceptual framework, and robot successes and failures. Participants include both academics and industry designers with a mixture of researchers studying human and animal legged locomotion and those designing and controlling walking robots. One goal of Dynamic walking is to bring together researchers from different fields, especially biomechanists and roboticists. Despite sharing a common interest in walking, these two groups typically lack a shared vocabulary and set of tools. As a result, a central focus for the conference is bridging these two disciplines and, ultimately, breaking down barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2029956': \"The purposes of this conference are to organize scholarly work about equity in science education and to broaden the set of scholars in science education who have equity as a focus. Equity has become a niche focus for many science education scholars, but the idea that science education should reach all students should be fundamental to all high quality teaching and learning. Scholars have documented policies and strategies that expand the diversity of individuals engaging in science. In turn, practitioners have incorporated these advances into science classroom practice. Better science learning opportunities can occur without diminishing expectations. However, many important projects are only known to local participants and a few outsiders. The conference will gather these scattered materials into a centralized collection. Producing consensus documents about equity-centered science education will provide a common body of knowledge. Having these shared referents will help to consolidate and coordinate research activity. Such documents will also have value for science education stakeholders engaged in professional development, policy enactments, and instructional reforms. The second purpose of this project is to plan for sustaining these efforts beyond the time of the conference. Because of current societal and educational dynamics, it is important to be strategic and planful about subsequent and synchronized ventures within an ongoing campaign for equity centered science education.<br/><br/>Demographical and institutional shifts make it necessary to attend to inequities within science education. Disparities by race and ethnicity are troublingly persistent in terms of representation in science careers, of college students majoring in science and engineering, by secondary school enrollments in advanced science courses, and in K-12 student outcomes on measures of science achievement. Such patterns are often reduced to deficit thinking about human potential. Deficit explanations are related to biased expectations by classroom teachers, inappropriate course tracking practices within secondary schools, uneven attention and support by college advisors and university faculty, and hostile work environments throughout academic and corporate STEM settings. In contrast, introducing asset mindsets about marginalized populations has the potential to contradict biased views about who can and cannot be successful in science. This project is creating a multifaceted mentoring initiative to assist scholars with maximizing impacts and sustaining themselves within their chosen professions. Among participants, there is considerable variety of career trajectories and depth of experiences. This diversity is creating a robust network of scholars from fields adjacent to science education: organizational change, school counseling, teacher leadership, technology education, and urban schooling. The conference is providing support mechanisms to increase scholars’ human capital through an organizational infrastructure to foster the professional community’s continued growth. Activities subsequent to this conference are continuing to support this community, maintaining equity at its core rather than an auxiliary feature of scholarship in science education. The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers, through the research and development of new innovations and approaches. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for the projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2047057': \"The response of ocean ecosystems to global environmental change is an important concern for ocean scientists and the public. The proposed research focuses on developing chemical tools to investigate how marine microbes respond and adapt to changes in their surrounding environment, such as increasing temperature, ocean acidification, oxygen loss, and availability of nutrients. Modifications in the lipids (a.k.a. biomarkers, or fats) present in the cell membranes of all known forms of life allow organisms to cope with environmental stress. The team will use “lipidomics,” an emerging field that involves studying the complete set of lipids produced by a given organism or an entire ecosystem, to understand how microbes can adapt to the global-scale changes in the environment impacting the ocean. They will do this using mesocosm and microcosm experiments. Mesocosms are large-scale outdoor experimental systems that examine the natural environment under semi-controlled conditions. Microcosms are small-scale indoor experimental systems that allow controlled experimentation of individual organisms or simplified ecosystems with one or more parameters. These systems offer unparalleled teaching opportunities about the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and their interaction with the physical and chemical environment. In parallel with the research efforts, the CU Boulder team will lead an effort to enhance bilingual (English/Spanish) ocean educational curriculum and activities for school children and teachers, particularly from underprivileged backgrounds, as well as the general public in the landlocked state of Colorado. <br/><br/>Recent advances in lipidomics now allow the use of lipids as indicators of microbial adaptation to environmental change. This CAREER project uses an integrated experimental and educational approach to examine: (a) lipid remodeling in natural microbial communities exposed to multiple environmental stressors tied to varying upwelling intensity, explored through large scale mesocosm experiments; b) lipid remodeling in key phytoplankton groups isolated from upwelling ecosystems, subjected to selected environmental stressors in microcosm and culture experiments; and (c) new bilingual (English/Spanish) educational modules and outreach opportunities that will enhance ocean literacy with the aim of inspiring and empowering citizens to promote the health of our oceans. The work will test the overarching hypotheses that experimental studies allow the distinction between changes in lipidome caused by varying biological sources (phylogeny) and physiological adaptation (lipid remodeling) of source organisms exposed to changing physical-chemical conditions. Results will illuminate the application of intact polar lipids (IPLs) in observational oceanography for the study of microbial adaptation to future scenarios of global change—something that to date has not been rigorously tested. In addition, this study will further inform the interpretation of biomarkers preserved in marine sediments as tracers of past microbial and biogeochemical processes. The educational focus will be implemented through the School at Sea that includes: (a) development of educational modules (Microcosm-in-a-Mason-jar and Mesocosm-in-my-backyard experiments) for students in grades 5-8 that will be tested in local schools and then disseminated in stablished education and outreach programs at CU Boulder; (b) promotion of ocean literacy among high school students as well as minority and community college undergraduate students; (c) training of the next generation of science educators and volunteers (Sea Rangers) in activities that will promote ocean literacy. Furthermore, results from this study will serve as the basis for curriculum development for undergraduate courses in global change and organic geochemistry. Key partnerships with CU’s Museum of Natural History through the Girls At the Museum Exploring Science (GAMES) program, Science Discovery Program, and CIRES’s Education and Outreach Office, as well as the Inland Ocean Coalition will provide platforms for the dissemination of School at Sea to a broader audience of students and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2011577': \"Gap junctions are cellular channels that are critical for cell-to-cell communication. The main component of gap junctions are the connexin proteins.  This Project is expected to describe a new mechanism by which gap junctions assemble at the surface of the cell.  This Project will determine the extent that connexins can be recycled and re-used in the formation of new functional gap junction channels. It will also identify the molecular mechanisms that regulate connexin recycling versus degradation.  Together, this will provide a better understanding of the turnover and trafficking of connexins. This knowledge will be useful for understanding the numerous cellular phenomena in which cell-cell communication is critical. Experimentally collected data will also be used to develop software that will mathematically predict how the modification of connexins determines their biological functions, including movement to different cytoplasmic compartments. The Broader Impacts of the Project are three-fold, broadening participation in science, creating novel science-oriented art exhibits, and providing research training. Participation in science will be strengthened by providing an opportunity for individuals from the University of Pittsburgh, smaller colleges from extended rural areas surrounding Pittsburgh, and minority serving institutions to participate in innovative research opportunities, to which they would not otherwise have access.  Training will be provided to researchers at all levels, from undergraduates and graduate students to postdoctoral fellows and visiting professors.  They will gain hands on training in the use of cutting edge imaging and mathematical modeling tools to study protein dynamics, recycling and degradation.  Scientific and computational workshops, where students will actively use modeling software to analyze experimental morphological data, will lead to novel insights, as well as interesting training and career paths. In addition, students will be directed in the production of installation art depicting protein dynamics and regulated cell behavior. These art exhibits will be presented at workshops, in the community, and at local art museums. These exhibits are intended to encourage career paths in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). In addition, they will introduce and familiarize the public with the world of research, highlighting the beauty and intricacy of living cells. <br/><br/><br/>The major protein subunits of gap junctions are the connexin proteins, the most abundant of which is connexin 43. The Project will test the hypothesis that recycling of connexin 43 contributes to the formation of new gap junction channels.  Specifically, the first Aim of this proposal will determine the dynamics of connexin 43 after endocytosis in multiple cell types.  In the second Aim, the hypothesis will be tested that endocytosis and recycling of connexins can be regulated by multiple kinases and phosphatases. To test these hypotheses, the PI will use biochemistry, confocal microscopy, morphological, and cell biological methods, in combination with phosphor-mimetics and pharmacological activators.  Aim 3 will use the dynamic parameters for endocytosis, recycling and degradation to generate a differential rate-equation model that will characterize and predict details of connexin trafficking.  Information gained from this study and the training provided will advance the science of cell-cell communication that is ultimately needed to understand complex physiological processes, and thus contribute to public welfare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2020972': \"This project aims to serve the national interest in excellent STEM education by creating a practice-based online learning experience for future STEM teachers. Many STEM teachers enter the classroom with limited experience asking effective questions and facilitating productive STEM class discussions. This project will develop online experiences to help future STEM teachers develop valuable teaching, questioning, and discussion skills before beginning classroom field experiences.  Teacher skills have been correlated with teacher turnover, job satisfaction, and student outcomes. Thus, improving teaching skills has the potential to increase persistence in teaching careers.  To foster teaching skill development, the online learning experiences in a simulated classroom will provide repeated opportunities for STEM undergraduate students to practice teaching skills. This approach includes deliberate practice within simulations, timely peer and mentor feedback, and guided self-reflection. All feedback will be based on the Danielson (2013) rubric allowing transferability of findings to other settings and providing information that is independent of the experts providing the feedback. Anticipated project outcomes include the development of effective practice-based teacher education learning experiences, replication of online instructional activities, and preparation of future teachers to ask effective questions and encourage stimulating STEM discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project engages undergraduate preservice STEM students through the online instructional platforms,   Mursion™ and Canvas™.  Canvas™ provides a comprehensive learning management system that will enable the undergraduate pre-service teachers to engage in deliberate practice.  For example, they can record their actions, post the recording, receive feedback, and use the feedback to improve their actions.  Mursion™ provides a simulated classroom environment using avatar students.  Through these virtual platforms, the future teachers can engage in repeated practice to develop skills in creating and posing specific questions to elicit evidence of STEM student understanding. Using a mixed-methods research design, the project has potential to advance: (1) practice-based undergraduate preservice STEM teacher preparation; (2) the use of online platforms to create synchronous and asynchronous STEM teacher skill practice opportunities; and (3) an infrastructure to develop questioning and discussion techniques that could be replicated for other important teaching skills. Results of this project will be disseminated through professional avenues (i.e. national and local conferences and peer-reviewed journals), the NSF video showcase, and a project website. This project will benefit the STEM education community by providing online, replicable practice-based approaches that can be used for teacher preparation. This project’s practice-based teacher preparation approach, practice-based instructional activities, and online infrastructure will be replicable by other teacher preparation programs.

       " '2017106': \"The amount of carbon present in soils is larger than the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This means changes in soil carbon storage can affect the climate. Soil carbon also affects the fertility of agricultural soil, and can influence local water quality. Given such significant implications on human and environmental wellbeing, this proposal seeks to enhance understanding of soil carbon storage. Research will focus on the role of rivers, which control the amount of time soil remains on landscapes before being eroded and which, through flooding, influence where new soil is formed. Rivers can also influence the chemical conditions in soil that affect soil carbon. Work will take place in a watershed containing only volcanic rocks to avoid the “fossil” carbon present in other rock types. Key outcomes include a new predictive model for soil carbon, the training of a graduate student and two elementary school teachers in biogeochemistry, and the development of bilingual educational materials for elementary school students. <br/><br/>The biogeochemical mechanisms thought to stabilize terrestrial organic carbon (OC) all evolve over similar (millennial) timescales to the duration over which soil and sediment are stored on landscapes. Consequently, a holistic view of the terrestrial OC cycle that leverages knowledge of the storage processes has the potential improve predictions and reveal novel dynamics, but requires new data and quantitative models for validation and application. This work aims to address these specific knowledge gaps by testing 3 hypotheses related to the coupling between soil, sediment, and OC storage: (1) the age distribution of OC inherits its shape from the fluvial processes that regulate storage times, (2) storage processes influence the loci and biogeochemical mechanisms(s) of OC preservation via fluvial controls on grain size sorting and hydrology, and (3) post-glacial landscape evolution increases the size of the terrestrial OC reservoir via an increase in landscape soil and sediment storage. These hypotheses will be evaluated using estimates of sediment storage from remote-sensing and surveying, radionuclide-based determinations of sediment and OC storage times, as well as elemental, molecular, and isotopic constraints on the biogeochemical mechanisms of OC preservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",

This project proposes a forward-looking solution suite for beyond-5G extreme mobility. It eliminates the 4G/5G limitations for extreme mobility by enabling predictive wireless design and simplified yet more efficient wide-area mobility support. If successful, this work will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in wireless networks. To maximize the impact, the researchers will collaborate with industry and release software to the public. The research outcome will also be incorporated into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes a forward-looking, transformative solution suite to beyond-5G extreme mobility. It first unveils 5G's deficiencies in extreme mobility under various scenarios and studies the client and infrastructure's proper roles in supporting them. It then develops novel approaches to accurately predict wireless channel by extracting delay-Doppler of the multipath and exploiting their temporal locality. In this way, it eliminates slow channel feedback in high-speed mobility and adapts to the fast-varying channel in extreme mobility. It further uses the predicted channel to enable predictive rate adaptation, resource allocation, and MIMO optimization under high mobility. Finally, it designs latency-friendly and interpretable distributed machine learning (ML) to help clients analyze the latency bottlenecks, and perform cross-layer latency optimizations. The proposed research will be evaluated using a software-defined radio prototype and large-scale emulation driven by operational 4G/5G traces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2041340': \"The urgent need for rapid, inexpensive, and convenient methods to detect viruses has been clearly evidenced by the onset of Covid-19, which caused the death of over 2 million prople worldwide from mid November 2019 to mid January 2021, and continues to take its toll on human life.  The 2020 Nobel Prize winning CRISPR/Cas technology, which can be used to rapidly detect DNA sequences in any living organism, offers a promising approach.  This approach has been pursued by many companies, but none to date has been able to match the sensitivity of the “gold standard” test (real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)), which requires 4-6 hours for completion and costs ~$100 per test.  Thus the goal of this project is to develop a method for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19) detection that is faster, cheaper, more sensitive, and more convenient than the methods presently used for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The project’s goals will be achieved by integrating CRISPR/Cas assays with cutting-edge technologies.  Limitations of existing systems will be addressed using a number of advanced analysis tools, advanced devices, artifical inteligence, and novel nanomaterial probes to design an integrated nanopore-microfluidic device for use in point-of-care (POC) settings that is ASSURED (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable to end users). Succesful development of this sensor platform will offer a wide range of other uses, as the principles behind it may be applied to other applications that are not related to SARS-CoV-2.  The project creates excellent opportunities for interdisciplinary research, as it combines biochemistry, nanoengineering, photonics, and medicine. Outreach programs related to this exciting project will be offered to K-12 schools, attracting young minds and inspiring them to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) degrees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a highly sensitive and reliable nucleic acid sensing tool based on CRISPR/Cas assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The research will reveal the cleavage activities of Cas enzymes on a variety of composite nanomaterial reporter designs.  Solid-state nanopores will be optimized for reading the cleavage patterns of nanomaterial reporters in the Cas assays using a deep neural network to classify the cleavage signatures. Solid-state nanopore readout provides single-molecule quantification and also identifies molecular signatures within the translocating molecules, which has significant advantages over the standard readout methods of today (fluorescence, paper-strip, colorimetric, and electrochemical readout). Once the cleavage activities are understood, a variety of reporters whose cleavage patterns correspond to specific target sequences will be designed. Identification of the cleavage products will enable the development of an integrated nanopore-microfluidic device for use in POC settings that will demonstrate simultaneous nanopore and fluorescence readings of cleavage products in multiplexed CRISPR/Cas assays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2055335': \"With this award, the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanisms-B program is supporting fundamental research in the field of photochemistry, carried out by Arthur Winter at Iowa State University. The absorption of light by molecules can lead to cleavage of chemical bonds but it is often difficult to understand why or how specific bonds break. Dr. Winter and his students seek to understand the structure-reactivity principles for one general type of bond cleavage, specifically photochemical heterolysis of bonds between carbon and a leaving group.   Heterolysis represents one of the possible ways in which a chemical bond can break, with both of the two electrons in the bond being given to one of the departing groups.  Photoheterolysis reactions are important in biology, materials science and environmental chemistry. The long-term goal in this project is to create a predictive theoretical framework, which can relate chemical structure to excited state reactivity, thereby providing new guiding mechanistic principles that direct photochemical reactions.  Among broader impacts activities, Professor Winter will also be involved with a Freshman Research Initiative that involves first year college students in an early multidisciplinary research experience. He will also continue to recruit undergraduates and students from underrepresented groups into his lab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To study these photoheterolysis reactions, the PI will employ a combined  theoretical/experimental approach. High-level computational methods will be used to map excited state transition states and surface crossing topologies in model systems. Experimentally, spectroscopy will determine the effect of structure on the rates and mechanisms of photorelease in model systems. In particular, ultrafast femtosecond-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy will be used to determine the rates and mechanisms of photoheterolysis reactions on selected substrates, while high-level excited state calculations will be used to provide a mechanistic rationale.

Despite the many existing strategies that have been studied for selectively converting alkene building blocks into value-added products, there are still challenges associated with the formation of product mixtures and the need for wasteful intermediate synthetical steps. Dr. Young and his research team are working to control the reactions of alkenes with simple and abundant reaction additives such as carbon dioxide. These studies have the potential to permit for more efficient syntheses of valuable chemical building blocks for new pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and next generation materials.

Not only is the theory of geometric flows a fundamental subject in mathematics, but it also has potential applications to other scientific fields including computer sciences, material sciences and physics. One of the most important problems in the study of geometric flows is to understand all possible singularities of the flows, which are in turn modeled by self-similar solutions of the flows. The proposed research on the moduli space of such self-similar solutions is expected to broaden and advance the knowledge and techniques both within and outside of mathematics, such as the topology of manifolds, image processing, crystal growths and the large-scale structure of the universe. In the meanwhile, new ideas and tools will be developed in various mathematical disciplines ranging from differential geometry to analysis. In addition, the PI will continue mentoring and organizing seminars and workshops for undergraduates, graduate students and young researchers. The PI will also actively participate in the promotion of women in mathematics to enhance diversity and gender equity in the society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this proposed project is to establish various geometric and analytic properties of the space of self-similar solutions of geometric flows. First, the PI, in the continuing collaboration with Brett Kotschwar at the Arizona State University, will apply the Carleman type technique to attack the rigidity problem for noncompact gradient Ricci solitons. Second, appealing to the tools inspired in part by the theory of minimal surfaces, the PI aims to describe a much detailed picture of two-dimensional smooth noncompact self-shrinkers of finite genus of mean curvature flow. To achieve this, the PI will begin with investigating the asymptotic structures at infinity of such self-shrinkers which are conjectured to be regular cones or cylinders. Then the PI intends to address the Cylinder Rigidity Conjecture of Ilmanen concerning the uniqueness of self-shrinking cylinders. At the end, the PI, with Joel Spruck at the Johns Hopkins University, plans to seek the sufficient and necessary conditions of the existence of the asymptotic Dirichlet problem for the self-shrinker equation. Third, in higher dimensions, the PI, joint with Neshan Wickramasekera at the University of Cambridge, will extend the regularity theory of stable minimal submanifolds to derive estimates on the size of singular sets of entropy stable weak self-shrinkers.',\n",
       " '2018547': \"This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Bucknell University is acquiring a high-pressure liquid-chromatograph ion mobility, quadrupole mass spectrometer (HPLC-IM-Q-TOF) to support Professor Douglas Collins and colleagues Moria Chambers and Lou Tom from Susquehanna University. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are made into ions and the ions' masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the structure of molecules in complex mixtures to be studied. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph can separate mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer's analyzer. The ion mobility (IM) component provides a method that separates gas phase ions based on their interactions with a gas depending on their masses. Initially, the ions are quickly separated and then they are introduced into the mass analyzer. This complex instrument is useful to analyze samples from the human body (proteomics and metabolomics). The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by enabling diverse students to gain familiarity with this modern analytical technique. The HPLC-IM-Q-TOF is also used in outreach activities involving students from Susquehanna University.<br/><br/>The award of the mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts exploration of supramolecular host-guest chemistry and mechanistic studies of porous and the formation of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COF).

       " '2038697': 'Computational and data science skills have become essential in making scientific discoveries, especially in fields where the integration of diverse sources of observational and modeled data is required to understand the mechanisms and functions of complex systems, such as the Earth’s ocean. However, conventional ocean sciences education focuses predominantly on domain-specific knowledge and often falls short in explicitly incorporating these operational skills into the curriculum. The PIs will plan and host several workshops, a virtual workshop in 2020 and two in-person workshops in 2021, that aim to address this urgent need by combining immersive tutorials on state-of-the-art data science methodologies, peer-learning, and on-site collaborative hack project work in a 5-day intensive workshop. This is a domain-specific adaptation of the “hackweek” model, which has emerged in the computational data science community as a powerful model for educating new users, sharing technical expertise, and building an inclusive and cohesive community. The focus of the workshops is the use of ocean data, and specifically the use of data from the NSF-funded Ocean Observatories Initiative. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops, called \"OceanHackWeek2020-2021\", provide an avenue for expediting the adoption of data science methodologies and computational tools for data-intensive research in the ocean sciences community. These skills are indispensable for modern-day oceanographers to tackle complex scientific questions by harnessing the data revolution. OceanHackWeek differs from traditional academic conferences and one-off hackathons by its immersive curriculum, collaborative learning environment, and a set of carefully crafted participant selection criteria that helps promote diversity and inclusivity. These designs help spur collaborative interdisciplinary ideas and help promote best data science practices in ocean sciences. OceanHackWeek focuses not only on promoting data science literacy but also on building an inclusive and cohesive community of oceanographers for learning and sharing. The organizers encourage and empower participants to bring the skills gained and the sense of community formed during the hackweek back to their own labs and institutions. Beyond the intensive in-person workshop, OceanHackWeek tutorials will be maintained as persistent open online resources to allow anyone to partake and self-learn. By facilitating and catalyzing the growth and change of individuals through grassroot efforts that promote and embrace a diverse community, OceanHackWeek drives cultural change in the field of oceanography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF\\'s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation\\'s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.',\n",
       " '2051621': \"Industrial control systems (ICS) operates critical industrial infrastructure such as water and power, oil and gas, manufacturing and logistics, and other essential industries. Such systems consists of a complex network of interactive systems that control the critical aspects of the physical world. Traditionally, these control systems have been designed for isolated environments with no communication with the outside world. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has played a key role in connecting ICS elements to the Internet. Their governing protocols, however, have not fundamentally changed to incorporate security principles into their design. There is a need for performing comprehensive security analyses on ICS protocols for their safe and secure operations over the Internet. The broader impacts include partnerships with industry, and broadening the research participation of students from underrepresented backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to explore a viable path to conduct a security analysis on ICS system protocols. This is challenging as ICS systems implement a mix of closed and open-source protocols and logging all execution paths of these protocols is not feasible. The project leverages model inference techniques to gain insights into the working of ICS protocols. The key technique is to record the Finite State Machines (FSMs) of ICS protocols to infer their implementation models. The inferred model is then used to identify the protocols’ states and their transitions which are then validated against the security properties for analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2005927': \"Interest in making and makerspaces -- collaborative workspaces where people can engage in a process of creating something from separate elements (using high and no tech tools) -- has grown steadily in recent years. While these spaces offer opportunity for individuals and multi-generational groups to work together, there is also more broad interest in structured youth programming that involves maker-related activities and content. Yet, research-informed professional development that focuses on how informal educators implement, plan, and handle ongoing, just-in-time support during moments of failure is scarce. Prior research supports the important role of failure in maker programming to increase learning, resilience, self-efficacy and other skills such as independence. This project will address the gap through adapting, implementing, and refining a professional development program for informal educators to productively attend, interpret, and respond to youths’ experiences with failure while engaged in maker programs. The contexts for this research are museums that provide maker programming. This Innovations in Development project uses a train-the-trainer approach to professional development. Up to two lead facilitators at each partnering institution experience an initial three-day workshop and ongoing support meetings during the first phase. In the second phase, the lead facilitators support other informal educators at their institution implementing making programs for youth. This project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education as collaborations and professional learning communities will be established among a variety of informal learning institutions. Core partners include: The Tech Museum of Innovation, The Bakken Museum, Montshire Museum of Science, The Minneapolis Institute of Art, Thinkery, and Amazeum Children’s Museum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central hypothesis framing the work is that a professional development program focused on supporting informal educators' instructional practices on ways to respond to youths' experiences with failure will have a positive impact on developing participants developing pedagogical practices around failure, as well as developing youths' affinity for resilience during making tasks and a strong sense of self as a maker. The project utilizes a strengths-based perspective of the resilience that allows the team to consider promotive factors or variables that help youth overcome negative effects of failures. The project draws from research highlighting the positive impact of professional development on teacher knowledge and beliefs, classroom practice, and student outcomes adapting the Problem-Solving Cycle model of Borko, Koellner, and Swackhamer to the context of museums. The specific R&amp;D aims are to: (1) Investigate features of the professional development models that best support lead facilitators in supporting informal educators in attending, interpreting, and responding to youths' experiences with failure while engaged in making tasks; (2) Investigate changes of informal educators' pedagogical practice around youths' experiences with failures through engaging in the professional development models; and (3) Examine shifts in youths' resiliency and perception of failure. A goal of the work is to raise the importance of failure in the overall learning process. The iterative nature of this project will be informed by the collection and analysis of video data of professional development sessions and informal educators facilitating maker programs, reflective journaling, surveys regarding the professional development, and pre-post surveys from youth engaged in the maker programs. Dissemination will address multiple stakeholders, including informal educators, program developers, evaluators, researchers, and public audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " '2032153': \"Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused two serious epidemics in humans (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) and the current COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV2). There is evidence suggesting that although these CoVs originated from bats, other mammals could have been intermediate hosts that transmitted the virus to humans. Research supported by this award will help to identify animal populations that are likely susceptible to the current pandemic CoV (SARS-CoV2) and could potentially act as viral reservoirs and initiate new disease outbreaks. Determining the animal receptors that enable SARS-CoV2 cell entry will benefit both human and animal health by directing future studies of CoV tropism. This knowledge will also focus surveillance efforts to species most likely involved in zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV2 and other CoVs. This proposal will train undergraduate research students in computational and laboratory skills during the proposed project.  Results from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, posted to shared data repositories, and also shared through social media.<br/><br/>Research supported by this award will employ computational modeling and empirical laboratory research to identify animal angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptors that confer susceptibility to SARS-CoV2. Researchers will test the hypothesis that certain amino acid residues in animal ACE2 are essential for coronavirus (CoV) spike protein interaction and cell entry. A computational pipeline will be developed to model and simulate the docking of the SARS-CoV2 receptor binding domain to the ACE2 cell receptor from hundreds of divergent animal species. We will also empirically test the capacity of SARS-CoV2 spike protein to utilize ACE2 through heterologous expressions systems and in vitro cell culture studies. The research has the potential to identify a wide spectrum of animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV2. This will aid in the understanding of the relationship between ACE2 genotype and SARS-CoV2 cell entry and allow the prediction of ACE2 residues that are critical for determining CoV susceptibility.  This RAPID award is made by the Symbiosis, Defense, and Self-recognition Program in the BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\"}"
